    <content type="text/markdown">**AI Applications: Quotas**

AI Applications offers the following allocation quotas in the global region (`global`), the US multi-region (`us`), and the EU multi-region (`eu`) under the Discovery Engine API:

* Number of data stores per project
* Number of documents per project
* Number of engines per project
* Number of user events

The number of data stores, documents, user events, and engines across all locations can't exceed the total per-project quota for that resource.

For more information, see [Quotas](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/quotas).</content>
    <summary>This is a longer summary about AI Applications quotas across different regions (global, US, EU) for the Discovery Engine API. It details the limits on data stores, documents, engines, and user events per project, emphasizing that the total across all locations cannot exceed the per-project quota.</summary>

    <content type="text/markdown">**Vertex AI Search: Search for an exact match (GA)**

To search for an exact match, you can enclose your search query in double quotes (`"`). For example, when you search for `"Mary had a little lamb"`, Vertex AI Search looks for the phrase exactly as it is. It doesn't return search results that contain `Mary had lamb`, which has missing words; or `a little lamb had Mary`, which has the words in a different order.

This feature is Generally available when you use the [`engines.servingConfigs.search`](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.collections.engines.servingConfigs/search) method to get search results for [custom data](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/preview-search-results), [media data](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/get-media-search-results), and [healthcare data](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/search-hc-data).</content>
    <summary>You can now search for exact phrases using double quotes in Vertex AI Search. This feature is available for custom, media, and healthcare data when using the search method.</summary>
