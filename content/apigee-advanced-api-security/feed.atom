    <content type="text/markdown">**New model for Abuse Detection's Advanced Anomaly Detection rule**

With this release, we introduced a new and improved machine learning model for anomaly detection in Advanced API Security. This new model includes the following improvements:

* **Trained on customer-specific traffic patterns.** The new model is trained exclusively on your organization's historical API traffic data. It continues to learn from your API traffic patterns over time to increase accuracy.
* **Engineered by Google for anomaly detection.** The new model is a custom Vertex AI-based machine learning model, engineered and also used internally by Google specifically to detect anomalies in traffic patterns.

Usage requirements:

* In order to use this new model, you must explicitly opt in to allow the model to use your traffic and other data to train for anomaly detection. Note that your data is never shared with other customers for training purposes.
* The new model is not available for VPC-SC customers at this time.

The new anomaly detection model replaces the old model, with no customer-facing changes to the API or UI. Upon opting in for model training, you can expect to start seeing detected anomalies within 6 hours. If you have already opted in to allow the older version of our anomaly detection model to use your traffic data for training, you will not need to opt in again.

For more information on this model and on Abuse Detection, see [Abuse Detection customer documentation](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-security/abuse-detection), including [Detection rules](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-security/detection-rules).</content>
