# Apigee APIM Operator

## 2025-09-24

### Announcement

On September 24, 2025, we released an updated version of Apigee.

### Feature

**ApigeeBackendService for the Apigee Operator for Kubernetes (GA)**

The ApigeeBackendService resource for the Apigee Operator for Kubernetes is [Generally Available (GA)](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages).

This new resource enables the integration of the Apigee Operator for Kubernetes with the [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) Inference Gateway](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/about-gke-inference-gateway). The GKE Inference Gateway is an extension to the GKE Gateway that provides optimized routing and load balancing for serving generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads. It simplifies the deployment, management, and observability of AI inference workloads.

With this new integration, GKE Inference Gateway users can now leverage Apigee's full suite of features to manage, govern and monetize their AI workload through APIs.
