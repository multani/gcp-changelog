    <content type="text/markdown">| Bug ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 404509044 | When [configuring an SMTP server,](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/publish/portal/configure-email#cloud-console-ui-preview) and the portal is first provisioned, email notifications are sent to portal users from a generic sender address. This release updates that generic address to `noreply-apigee-portals@google.com`. |

This approach is suitable for evaluation, but you should configure your own SMTP server before launching your portal to users. When you configure the SMTP server, you can also configure the sender address, for example, `no-reply@mycompany.com`.</content>
    <summary>The sender email address for email notifications from newly provisioned portals has been updated to no-reply-apigee-portals@google.com. This change ensures a more specific sender address for initial email communications. Remember to configure your own SMTP server and preferred sender address before launching your portal to avoid using the generic address.</summary>
