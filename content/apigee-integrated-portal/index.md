### Announcement

On July 24, 2025 we began redirecting the following Apigee Classic UI navigation items to Apigee UI in the Google Cloud console:

* Publish > Portals

See [Apigee UI in Cloud console navigation](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/fundamentals/ui-overview#console-compare) for a mapping of each Classic Apigee UI feature page to its location in the Apigee UI in Cloud console.

See [Apigee Classic UI shutdown](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/deprecations/apigee-classic-ui) for details on shutdown dates.

If you require more time to transition to the Google Cloud console, submit the [exception request form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSedFe2Pj2f9B8YxD7cgWOyf8-IjRA8IhRZpZ2jXMZ9DU1uz1g/viewform) by Aug 15, 2025.

### Announcement

On June 2, 2025 we released a new version of the Apigee integrated portal.

### Fixed

| Bug ID | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 404509044 | When [configuring an SMTP server,](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/publish/portal/configure-email#cloud-console-ui-preview) and the portal is first provisioned, email notifications are sent to portal users from a generic sender address. This release updates that generic address to `noreply-apigee-portals@google.com`. |

This approach is suitable for evaluation, but you should configure your own SMTP server before launching your portal to users. When you configure the SMTP server, you can also configure the sender address, for example, `no-reply@mycompany.com`.

### Feature

**GA: Apigee Integrated Developer Portal Admin UI in the Google Cloud console.**

This release adds the Apigee Integrated Developer Portal Admin UI from the Classic Apigee UI into the Google Cloud console.

Leveraging Google Cloud console components provides API providers and Portal Admins with a centralized platform to efficiently configure, publish, and manage your API consumer portals, eliminating the need to switch between different UIs.

No new APIs have been introduced in this release.
