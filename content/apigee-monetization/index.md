## 2025-12-19

### Announcement

On December 19, 2025, we released an updated version of Apigee Monetization.

**Note:** Rollouts of this release to production instances have begun. Rollout may
take four or more business days to complete across all Google Cloud zones. Your
instances may not have the feature available until the rollout is complete.

### Feature

Monetization now supports AppGroups. Use AppGroups to manage API product
subscriptions for all app developers in the AppGroup at the same time.
