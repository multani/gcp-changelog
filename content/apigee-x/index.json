In this release, it's available in asia-east1, asia-northeast2, asia-south1, europe-north1, europe-west3, us-east1, us-south1, and us-west2 regions.\n\n### Changed\n\n*(Cloud Composer 3)* If a VPC network is attached to an environment, then all DNS addresses accessed by the Airflow components of the environment are resolved using the Cloud DNS configuration of the VPC network. In particular, Airflow workers that execute DAGs will resolve DNS addresses in this way.\n\n### Changed\n\n*(Cloud Composer 3)* All newly created private DNS zones are immediately visible to a Cloud Composer environment. Previously, re-attaching a VPC network was required.\n\n### Fixed\n\n*(Cloud Composer 3)* It's now possible to use [zones with cross-project binding](http://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/zones/cross-project-binding). Before this change, cross-project bound zones weren't supported in Cloud Composer 3.\n\n### Changed\n\n*(Cloud Composer 2)* In Cloud Composer versions 2.11.5 and later, log processing is switching to using OpenTelemetry instead of Fluentd.\n\nThis change was [announced previously](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/release-notes#May_14_2025) and is gradually rolling out over several releases. In this release, it's available in the following regions: asia-east1, asia-east2, asia-northeast2, asia-northeast3, asia-south2, asia-southeast2, australia-southeast1, australia-southeast2, europe-central2, europe-north1, europe-north2, europe-southwest1, europe-west, europe-west10, europe-west12, europe-west6, europe-west8, europe-west9, me-central1, me-central2, me-west1, northamerica-northeast2, northamerica-south1, southamerica-east1, southamerica-west1, us-east5, us-south1, us-west, and us-west3.\n\n### Changed\n\nNew [Airflow builds](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-versions#images-composer-3) are available in Cloud Composer 3:\n\n* [composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.5](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/versions-packages#composer-3-airflow-2-10-5-build-5) (default)\n* [composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.25](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/versions-packages#composer-3-airflow-2-9-3-build-25)\n\n### Changed\n\nNew [images](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-versions#images-composer-2) are available in Cloud Composer 2:\n\n* [composer-2.13.3-airflow-2.10.5](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/versions-packages#composer-2-13-3-airflow-2-10-5) (default)\n* [composer-2.13.3-airflow-2.9.3](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/versions-packages#composer-2-13-3-airflow-2-9-3)\n\n### Deprecated\n\nCloud Composer version 2.8.1 has reached its [end of support period](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-versioning-overview#version-deprecation-and-support).\n\nCloud Data Fusion\n-----------------\n\n### Changed\n\nThe [Salesforce plugin](https://cloud.google.com/data-fusion/docs/how-to/configure-salesforce-batch-source) version 1.6.10 is available in Cloud Data Fusion versions 6.10.1 and 6.11.0.
