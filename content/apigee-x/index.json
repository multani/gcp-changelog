This is achieved by showing or hiding user interface elements. This feature is in [preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages).\n\n### Feature\n\nBigQuery now supports using [Spanner external datasets](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/spanner-external-datasets) with [authorized views](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/authorized-views), [authorized routines](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/authorized-routines), and [Cloud resource connections](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/create-cloud-resource-connection).

In this release, it's available in asia-east1, asia-northeast2, asia-south1, europe-north1, europe-west3, us-east1, us-south1, and us-west2 regions.\n\n### Changed\n\n*(Cloud Composer 3)* If a VPC network is attached to an environment, then all DNS addresses accessed by the Airflow components of the environment are resolved using the Cloud DNS configuration of the VPC network. In particular, Airflow workers that execute DAGs will resolve DNS addresses in this way.\n\n### Changed\n\n*(Cloud Composer 3)* All newly created private DNS zones are immediately visible to a Cloud Composer environment. Previously, re-attaching a VPC network was required.\n\n### Fixed\n\n*(Cloud Composer 3)* It's now possible to use [zones with cross-project binding](http://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/zones/cross-project-binding). Before this change, cross-project bound zones weren't supported in Cloud Composer 3.\n\n### Changed\n\n*(Cloud Composer 2)* In Cloud Composer versions 2.11.5 and later, log processing is switching to using OpenTelemetry instead of Fluentd.\n\nThis change was [announced previously](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/release-notes#May_14_2025) and is gradually rolling out over several releases. In this release, it's available in the following regions: asia-east1, asia-east2, asia-northeast2, asia-northeast3, asia-south2, asia-southeast2, australia-southeast1, australia-southeast2, europe-central2, europe-north1, europe-north2, europe-southwest1, europe-west, europe-west10, europe-west12, europe-west6, europe-west8, europe-west9, me-central1, me-central2, me-west1, northamerica-northeast2, northamerica-south1, southamerica-east1, southamerica-west1, us-east5, us-south1, us-west, and us-west3.\n\n### Changed\n\nNew [Airflow builds](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-versions#images-composer-3) are available in Cloud Composer 3:\n\n* [composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.5](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/versions-packages#composer-3-airflow-2-10-5-build-5) (default)\n* [composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.25](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/versions-packages#composer-3-airflow-2-9-3-build-25)\n\n### Changed\n\nNew [images](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-versions#images-composer-2) are available in Cloud Composer 2:\n\n* [composer-2.13.3-airflow-2.10.5](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/versions-packages#composer-2-13-3-airflow-2-10-5) (default)\n* [composer-2.13.3-airflow-2.9.3](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/versions-packages#composer-2-13-3-airflow-2-9-3)\n\n### Deprecated\n\nCloud Composer version 2.8.1 has reached its [end of support period](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-versioning-overview#version-deprecation-and-support).\n\nCloud Data Fusion\n-----------------\n\n### Changed\n\nThe [Salesforce plugin](https://cloud.google.com/data-fusion/docs/how-to/configure-salesforce-batch-source) version 1.6.10 is available in Cloud Data Fusion versions 6.10.1 and 6.11.0. This release includes the following changes:\n\n* Upgraded Salesforce API version from 53.0 to 62.0 ([PLUGIN-1891](https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/PLUGIN-1891)).\n* Added a retry mechanism for all Salesforce API calls from the Salesforce plugin ([PLUGIN-1892](https://cdap.atlassian.net/browse/PLUGIN-1892)).\n\nCloud Monitoring\n----------------\n\n### Feature\n\nYou can now add treemap widgets to your custom dashboards. Treemaps display the\nmost recent value of aggregated data as a series of nested rectangles, the\ncolor saturation of a rectangle is proportional to the represented value.\nFor more information, see the following:\n\n* [Display the most recent value as a treemap](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/charts#dashboard_with_a_treemap_widget)\n* [API: Dashboard with a Treemap widget](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards/api-examples#dashboard_with_a_treemap_widget)\n\nCloud Storage\n-------------\n\n### Libraries\n\nA weekly digest of client library updates from across the [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk).\n\n### Go\n\n### Changes for [storage/internal/apiv2](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/tree/main/storage/internal/apiv2)\n\n#### [1.55.0](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/compare/storage/v1.54.0...storage/v1.55.0) (2025-05-29)\n\n##### Features\n\n* **storage/control:** Add Client Libraries Storage IntelligenceConfig ([2aaada3](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/commit/2aaada3fb7a9d3eaacec3351019e225c4038646b))\n* **storage/internal:** Add IpFilter to Bucket ([#12309](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/issues/12309)) ([d8ae687](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/commit/d8ae6874a54b48fce49968664f14db63c055c6e2))\n* **storage/internal:** Add Object.Retention message ([d8ae687](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/commit/d8ae6874a54b48fce49968664f14db63c055c6e2))\n\n##### Bug Fixes\n\n* **storage:** Add EnableNewAuthLibrary internalOption to HTTP newClient ([#12320](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/issues/12320)) ([0036073](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/commit/0036073affee5451894654a983fba6b2638433cb))\n* **storage:** Migrate oauth2/google usages to cloud.google.com/go/auth ([#11191](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/issues/11191)) ([3a22349](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/commit/3a22349c1ba6a192d70269f77e5804a9957aa572))\n* **storage:** Omit check on MultiRangeDownloader ([#12342](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/issues/12342)) ([774621c](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/commit/774621c5baa5110f57fe79d817143416bd671d1e))\n* **storage:** Retry url.Error and net.OpErrors when they wrap an io.EOF ([#12289](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/issues/12289)) ([080f6b0](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/commit/080f6b05c5e8bd5baaef71ed47f8d54c695f63d3))\n\n##### Documentation\n\n* **storage/internal:** Add explicit Optional annotations to fields that have always been treated as optional ([d8ae687](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/commit/d8ae6874a54b48fce49968664f14db63c055c6e2))\n* **storage/internal:** Add note that Bucket.project output format is always project number format ([d8ae687](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/commit/d8ae6874a54b48fce49968664f14db63c055c6e2))\n* **storage/internal:** Add note that managedFolders are supported for GetIamPolicy and SetIamPolicy ([d8ae687](https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go/commit/d8ae6874a54b48fce49968664f14db63c055c6e2))\n\nCompute Engine\n--------------\n\n### Feature\n\n**Preview**: The general-purpose C4D machine series offers bare metal (`-metal`) machine types with 384 vCPUs.
