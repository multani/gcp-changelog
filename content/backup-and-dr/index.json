This makes it easier than ever to adapt to evolving business needs, optimize for cost, and correct configuration errors on the fly.\n\nWhat's new:\n\n* Directly Edit Key Settings: You can now change the description, schedule, backup window, and retention periods of your existing backup plans. You can also add or remove backup rules as needed.\n* Automatic Updates: Once a plan is edited, the changes are automatically applied to all resources protected by that plan for all future backups. There's no need to manually detach and reattach the plan.\n* Backward Compatibility: This new capability is available for all backup plans, including those created before this update.\n\nImportant Note: While most settings in a backup plan are now editable, the assigned backup vault cannot be changed. To store backups in a different vault, a new backup plan must be created.",
