### Change

The Google Cloud console has been changed as follows:

* An **Overview** page for Capacity Planner has been added. You
  can use the **Overview** page to view data that summarizes the overall
  resource usage for a project, folder, or organization, including potential
  action items and the regional distribution of your resources.
* The data for the region distribution of your resources has been relocated:
  the doughnut charts have been replaced with a bar chart on the
  **Overview** page for Capacity Planner.

### Feature

**Preview**: You can use capacity requests to request a large number of resources for a future date and time, and across multiple regions or zones. When you use capacity requests, you get best-effort assurance for the capacity that Google Cloud provisions, and you only pay for resources when you use them. This approach helps ensure that your Google Cloud project has sufficient capacity to prevent resource availability errors during unexpected growth, without committing to pay for resources that you might not use.

For more information, see [About capacity requests](https://cloud.google.com/capacity-planner/docs/about-capacity-requests).
