<p>Colab Enterprise</p>
<hr />
<p>### Feature</p>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages">Generally available</a>: You can consume reservations with Colab Enterprise runtimes. Reservations of Compute Engine zonal resources help you gain a high level of assurance that your runtimes have the necessary resources to run.

<p>Compute Engine</p>
<hr />
<p>### Feature</p>
<p>For Hyperdisk Throughput, the maximum IOPS for a single volume has increased from 600 MiB/s to 2,400 MiB/s. The maximum IOPS for a single volume has increased from 2,400 IOPS to 9,600 IOPS. Hyperdisk Throughput volumes are designed for cost-sensitive workloads, analytics workloads, and workloads that have sequential I/O and large block sizes. For more information, see <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/hd-types/hyperdisk-throughput">About Hyperdisk Throughput</a>.</p>
<p>### Feature</p>
<p><strong>Generally Available</strong>: The storage-optimized Z3 machine series offers a bare metal (<code>z3-highmem-192-highlssd-metal</code>) machine type with 192 vCPUs, 1,536 GB of memory, and 72 TiB of Local SSD storage.</p>
<p>Bare metal instances let you create an instance with direct access to the machine's CPU and memory, without a virtualization layer in the middle. Z3 uses <a href="https://cloud.google.com/titanium">Titanium</a> to deliver more compute and memory resources for your workloads by offloading network and I/O processing from the host hardware. To learn more, see <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/storage-optimized-machines#z3_series">Z3 machine series</a>.

<p>### Fixed</p>
<p>A fix is available for an issue in which the Compute Engine Persistent Disk CSI
  driver failed with an <code>invalid cpuString</code> error on GKE nodes that used custom
  machine types. This issue prevented successful attachment and mounting of
  Persistent Disk volumes on affected nodes. The fix is available in the following
  GKE versions:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If your environment uses <code>dag-factory</code> package version 0.22, then you might
experience DAG failures in Cloud Composer versions that have
<code>apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes</code> package version 10.4.2 or later. At
the same time, upgrading the <code>dag-factory</code> package to version 0.23 might require
you to update your DAG code to make it compatible.</p>
<p>If your environment uses <code>dag-factory</code> version 0.22, we recommend to do the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily postpone upgrading your environment until you're ready to switch
  to <code>dag-factory</code> version 0.23. Last versions of Cloud Composer that support
  version 0.22 are composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.3,
  composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.23, composer-2.13.1-airflow-2.10.5, and
  composer-2.13.1-airflow-2.9.3 released on May 14, 2025.</li>
<li>When you are ready to upgrade, update your DAGs for compatibility with 0.23.
  We recommend to do this in a development environment first.
  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-3/install-python-dependencies">Install</a>
  <code>dag-factory</code> version 0.23, then check that your DAGs are parsed and are

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We're changing the way we provide support dates for Airflow builds in Cloud Composer 3. Before this change, some Airflow builds had their end of support date listed as "To be announced" until a later Airflow version became available. We're deprecating this approach for all builds that are released after July 01, 2025.</p>
<p>We are now providing support dates that depend on a date when a particular Airflow build was released:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are introducing the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-versioning-overview#version-deprecation-and-support">standard support period</a> of 12 months after the release date.</li>
<li>All Airflow builds that didn't have an end of support date when this change was introduced are supported until July 1, 2026. Because of this change, some Airflow builds released before July 1, 2025 are supported for longer than the standard support period.</li>
<li>All Airflow builds that had their support date shorter than 12 months are now supported for 12 months since the date of their initial release.</li>
<li>All builds released after July 1, 2025 will use the standard support period.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
    <summary>We are updating the support dates for Airflow builds in Cloud Composer 3. Starting July 1, 2025, all new builds will have a 12-month standard support period from their release date. Existing builds without a defined end of support date will now be supported until July 1, 2026, with some receiving extended support beyond the standard period.</summary>

If you use automation scripts to provision Cloud Composer 2 environments, make sure that you explicitly specify a Cloud Composer 2 version.</p>
<p>In this release, the change is rolling out in the following regions: africa-south1, asia-northeast2, asia-south2, asia-southeast2, europe-southwest1, europe-west10, europe-west12, europe-west8, me-central1, me-central2, me-west1, southamerica-west1, and us-south1.</p>]]></content>
