    <content type="text/markdown">If your environment uses `dag-factory` package version 0.22, then you might
experience DAG failures in Cloud Composer versions that have
`apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes` package version 10.4.2 or later. At
the same time, upgrading the `dag-factory` package to version 0.23 might require
you to update your DAG code to make it compatible.

If your environment uses `dag-factory` version 0.22, we recommend to do the
following:

* Temporarily postpone upgrading your environment until you're ready to switch
  to `dag-factory` version 0.23. Last versions of Cloud Composer that support
  version 0.22 are composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.3,
  composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.23, composer-2.13.1-airflow-2.10.5, and
  composer-2.13.1-airflow-2.9.3 released on May 14, 2025.
* When you are ready to upgrade, update your DAGs for compatibility with 0.23.
  We recommend to do this in a development environment first.
  [Install](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-3/install-python-dependencies)
  `dag-factory` version 0.23, then check that your DAGs are parsed and are
  working correctly, and update them if needed. After your DAGs are
  compatible, install `dag-factory` version 0.23 in your production
  environment and transfer the updated DAGs. Your environment can now be
  upgraded to a later version of Cloud Composer or Airflow.
* If your environment is already upgraded to a later version of Cloud Composer
  and you experience problems, then update `dag-factory` to version 0.23 and
  update your DAGs for compatibility with 0.23.</content>
    <summary>This announcement provides guidance on potential DAG failures in Cloud Composer when using dag-factory version 0.22 with specific Airflow provider versions. It recommends postponing upgrades or updating to dag-factory version 0.23 with necessary DAG code modifications.</summary>

    <content type="text/markdown">We're changing the way we provide support dates for Airflow builds in Cloud Composer 3. Before this change, some Airflow builds had their end of support date listed as "To be announced" until a later Airflow version became available. We're deprecating this approach for all builds that are released after July 01, 2025.

We are now providing support dates that depend on a date when a particular Airflow build was released:

* We are introducing the [standard support period](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-versioning-overview#version-deprecation-and-support) of 12 months after the release date.
* All Airflow builds that didn't have an end of support date when this change was introduced are supported until July 1, 2026. Because of this change, some Airflow builds released before July 1, 2025 are supported for longer than the standard support period.
* All Airflow builds that had their support date shorter than 12 months are now supported for 12 months since the date of their initial release.
* All builds released after July 1, 2025 will use the standard support period.</content>
    <summary>We are updating the support dates for Airflow builds in Cloud Composer 3. Starting July 1, 2025, all new builds will have a 12-month standard support period from their release date. Existing builds without a defined end of support date will now be supported until July 1, 2026, with some receiving extended support beyond the standard period.</summary>

    <content type="text/markdown">We are gradually rolling out a change that **switches the default version** from Cloud Composer 2 to Cloud Composer 3 in the Cloud Composer API.

In regions where the change is rolled out, a Cloud Composer 3 environment is created by default when a version is not specified in Google Cloud CLI, Cloud Composer API, or Terraform. If you use automation scripts to provision Cloud Composer 2 environments, make sure that you explicitly specify a Cloud Composer 2 version.

In this release, the change is rolling out in the following regions: africa-south1, asia-northeast2, asia-south2, asia-southeast2, europe-southwest1, europe-west10, europe-west12, europe-west8, me-central1, me-central2, me-west1, southamerica-west1, and us-south1.</content>
    <summary>The Cloud Composer API's default environment version is being updated from Cloud Composer 2 to Cloud Composer 3. This change will affect new environments created without a specified version in certain regions. Users relying on Cloud Composer 2 should explicitly select that version in their automation scripts.</summary>

    <content type="text/markdown">Cloud Composer 1 and Cloud Composer 2 environments with version 2.0.x are **approaching their end of life**. We're planning to deprecate them in the following way:

* Starting **September 15, 2025**, you will no longer be able to create new Cloud Composer 1 environments.
* On **September 15, 2026**, all Cloud Composer 1 and Cloud Composer 2 version 2.0.x environments will reach their planned end of life, and you **won't be able to use them**.

Cloud Composer 2 environments with versions later than 2.1.0 and all Cloud Composer 3 environments are not affected by this deprecation.

We recommend planning
[migration to Cloud Composer 3](https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/latest/migrate-composer-1-to-3)

    <content type="text/markdown">We're planning to phase out the APIs that aren't required by Cloud Composer 3.

* Starting **February 27, 2026**, the following APIs will **become fully detachable**. Deactivating these APIs won't cause the deactivation of the Cloud Composer API:

  + artifactregistry.googleapis.com
  + cloudbuild.googleapis.com
  + container.googleapis.com
  + pubsub.googleapis.com
  + sqladmin.googleapis.com
* Starting **May 27, 2026**, these APIs **will no longer be enabled automatically** when you enable the Cloud Composer API. To create Cloud Composer 2 environments in new projects, the group of detached APIs must be enabled manually.

Existing Cloud Composer 3 and Cloud Composer 2 environments in projects where the Cloud Composer API is already enabled will not be impacted. You can do the following:

* After **February 27, 2026**, if your project has only Cloud Composer 3 environments, then you can manually disable the detached APIs.
* After **February 27, 2026**, if your project has Cloud Composer 2 environments, then we recommend keeping these APIs enabled because disabling them might lead to environment's malfunction.
* After **May 27, 2026**, if you use automation scripts to provision Cloud Composer 2 environments, then make sure that the listed APIs are enabled in addition to the Cloud Composer API.</content>
    <summary>APIs not required by Cloud Composer 3 will be phased out starting February 27, 2026. Some APIs will become detachable, and after May 27, 2026, they will no longer be automatically enabled with the Cloud Composer API. Existing environments are not impacted, but users should adjust automation scripts and consider the impact on Cloud Composer 2 environments.</summary>
