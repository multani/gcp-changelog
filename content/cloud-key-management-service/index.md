### Feature

Cloud KMS now supports key encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs) for sharing secrets in Preview. KEMs are designed to be resistant to post-quantum attacks. You can use the following KEM algorithms:

* `ML_KEM_768`
* `ML_KEM_1024`
* `KEM_XWING`

For more information about key encapsulation mechanisms, see [Key encapsulation mechanisms](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/key-encapsulation-mechanisms). To learn how to use key encapsulation mechanisms to share secrets, see [Encapsulate and decapsulate using KEMs](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/encapsulate-decapsulate).
