    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Application Load Balancers and Proxy Network Load Balancers now support TLS certificates with large key sizes. Previously, these load balancers supported only certificates with RSA-2048 or ECDSA P-256 key types. With this update, you can now use self-managed certificates with RSA-3072, RSA-4096, and ECDSA P-384 keys.</p>
<p><strong>Key details</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supported key types (for self-managed certificates): RSA-2048, RSA-3072, RSA-4096, ECDSA P-256, and ECDSA P-384</li>
<li>
<p>Load balancing coverage for self managed certificates:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Certificate Manager SSL certificates: Global and regional load balancing</p>
</li>
<li>Compute Engine SSL Certificates: Regional load balancing</li>
<li>Pricing: An additional charge of $0.45 per 1 million connections applies with certificates that use RSA-3072 and RSA-4096 key types. There are no per-connection charges for certificates that use RSA-2048, ECDSA P-256, or ECDSA P-384 key types.</li>
</ul>
<p>For more information, see the documentation for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/ssl-certificates#key-types">Supported key types</a>.</p>

    <summary>Application Load Balancers and Proxy Network Load Balancers now support self-managed TLS certificates with larger key sizes, including RSA-3072, RSA-4096, and ECDSA P-384. This update expands the previously supported RSA-2048 and ECDSA P-256 key types. Note that certificates using RSA-3072 and RSA-4096 keys incur an additional charge of $0.45 per 1 million connections.</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In typical HTTPS communication, neither the load balancer nor the backend verify each other's identity, assuming that they are within a secure perimeter and can be trusted. However, when perimeter security needs reinforcement or communication extends beyond the perimeter, backend mTLS becomes essential. Backend mTLS ensures secure communication by requiring both the load balancer and the backend to mutually verify their identities.</p>
<p>With <em>backend authenticated TLS</em>, the load balancer verifies the backend server's certificate by checking its chain of trust, thereby confirming the backend's identity. Conversely, with <em>backend mTLS</em>, the backend server verifies the client certificate presented by the load balancer. Together, these mechanisms enable backend mTLS, ensuring that both parties validate each other's identity.</p>
<p>Backend mTLS complements frontend mTLS, which is already generally available (GA).</p>
<p>For details, see the following:</p>
