    <content type="text/markdown">This change affects clusters using both the `TRAFFIC_DIRECTOR` and `ISTIOD` control plane implementations.

When using Cloud Service Mesh with Istio APIs, configuring an [unsupported field](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/onboarding/unsupported-istio-apis) or value in an Istio Custom Resources will be reflected as an error in the Mesh status API.

In some cases, the validation webhook will also reject unsupported API usage with an error message indicating the specific unsupported API. For more information, see [Common webhook error messages](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-webhook#common_webhook_error_messages). You can mitigate these issues by amending the Istio Custom Resource to remove the specified unsupported API configuration.</content>
    <summary>This change affects Cloud Service Mesh users with Istio APIs. Configuring unsupported fields or values in Istio Custom Resources will now result in errors reported via the Mesh status API or validation webhook. To resolve these issues, remove the unsupported configurations from your Istio Custom Resources.</summary>
