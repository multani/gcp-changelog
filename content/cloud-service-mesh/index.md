# Cloud Service Mesh

## 2025-10-16

### Announcement

The promotion of [1.21 to the Rapid release channel](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/release-notes#May_06_2025) included upstream breaking changes to [ExternalName](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.21.x/announcing-1.21/upgrade-notes/#externalname-support-changes) and [auto-sni](https://istio.io/latest/news/releases/1.21.x/announcing-1.21/upgrade-notes/#default-value-of-the-feature-flag-enable_auto_sni-to-true) when using the `ISTIOD` [implementation](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/check-control-plane-implementation). After considering the impact on customers, we have decided to restore the previous behavior from 1.20 and earlier for managed Cloud Service Mesh clusters using the `ISTIOD` implementation to match Rapid clusters using the `TRAFFIC_DIRECTOR` implementation. These changes are rolling out to the Rapid release channel in version 1.21.5-asm.55 or later.

* If you are using an `ExternalName` service in the Rapid channel without a port description, the `ExternalName` service will not be translated into `Cluster` in the Envoy configuration. If the `ExternalName` service is a destination of `VirtualService` or `ExternalName` service is used with `REGISTRY_ONLY` mode, you must specify the port in the service like in 1.20 and earlier.
* If you have an external service multiplexing traffic based on SNI but the corresponding `DestinationRule` doesn't have an explicit SNI, you must [set SNI properly](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-security#explicit_sni_setup).

All features supported by Managed (TD) control planes are supported by this proxy. To identify which proxy version is used in a cluster, see [Identify the proxy versions used in the cluster](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-proxy#identify_the_proxy_version_used_in_the_cluster).

This release uses the version `csm_istio_proxy_20250611.00_p0`. More details about the proxy version can be found on the [Versions](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/versions) page.

### Security

**1.26.4-asm.1 is now available for in-cluster Cloud Service Mesh.**

This patch release contains a fix for a [use-after-free (UAF) vulnerability in the DNS cache](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2025-54588). For more information, see the [security bulletin](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/security-bulletins#gcp-2025-048).

Only clusters running in-cluster Cloud Service Mesh version 1.26 are affected. If you are running an earlier in-cluster version or managed Cloud Service Mesh, you are not affected and do not need to take any action.

For details on upgrading Cloud Service Mesh, refer to [Upgrade Cloud Service Mesh](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/upgrade/upgrade).

### Feature

You can now enforce cluster-local traffic for an individual service, all services in a particular namespace, or globally for all services in the mesh.

### Feature

[DNS Proxy feature](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/operate-and-maintain/dns-proxy) is now available in the Rapid release channel. This feature requires sidecar version `1.21.5-asm.39` or later.

### Changed

This change affects clusters using both the `TRAFFIC_DIRECTOR` and `ISTIOD` control plane implementations.

When using Cloud Service Mesh with Istio APIs, configuring an [unsupported field](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/onboarding/unsupported-istio-apis) or value in an Istio Custom Resources will be reflected as an error in the Mesh status API.

In some cases, the validation webhook will also reject unsupported API usage with an error message indicating the specific unsupported API. For more information, see [Common webhook error messages](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-webhook#common_webhook_error_messages). You can mitigate these issues by amending the Istio Custom Resource to remove the specified unsupported API configuration.

### Feature

Isolation support to prevent cross-region overflow is now available as a preview feature for `TRAFFIC_DIRECTOR` implementations of Cloud Service Mesh. For more information, see [Isolation for Cloud Service Mesh](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/service-routing/isolation).
