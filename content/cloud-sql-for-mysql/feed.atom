    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Cloud SQL now offers two options of backup services to manage your instance's backups:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced backups</strong> (<a href="https://cloud.google.com/products?#product-launch-stages">Preview</a>): backups are managed and stored in a centralized backup management project that leverages the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/backup-disaster-recovery">Backup and DR service</a>, and provides enforced retention, granular scheduling, and longer retention.</li>
<li><strong>Standard backups</strong> (existing option): backups are created, managed, and stored in the same project as your Cloud SQL instances.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose between these options based on your instance's requirements and needs. Although instances can't use both backup options at the same time, Cloud SQL gives you the ability to switch between these backup options as necessary.</p>
<p>For more information about the available options and their limitations, see <a href="https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/backup-recovery/backups#backup-options">Backup options</a>.</p>]]></content>
    <summary>Cloud SQL introduces enhanced backups with centralized management and longer retention, alongside standard backups. You can switch between options as needed.</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The write endpoint feature for Cloud SQL Enterprise Plus edition instances is now <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages">generally available</a> (GA). This endpoint is a global domain name service (DNS) name and resolves to the IP address of the current primary Cloud SQL instance that's enabled with private services access.</p>
