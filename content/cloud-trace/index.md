### Feature

Application-specific resource attributes are attached to your trace data when
your App Hub applications use supported Google Cloud resources,
or when you instrument an application with OpenTelemetry and use the
Google Cloud Telemetry endpoint. You can use the Trace Explorer to filter
by your application, your service, or your workload. To learn more, see the
following:
