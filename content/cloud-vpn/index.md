### Deprecated

Classic VPN full deprecation update

As of August 1, 2025, dynamic routing or Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) for Classic VPN tunnels is deprecated. If your workloads require BGP for VPN connectivity, you must use HA VPN.

Existing Classic VPN tunnels that use BGP will continue to function. However, they will no longer be supported and will operate without an availability SLA.

For more information, refer to [Classic VPN dynamic routing deprecation](https://cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/vpn/deprecations/classic-vpn-deprecation).
