        "content": "* **1-Click Deployer**: 1-Click deployer now deploys the\n  [Sustainability](https://cloud.google.com/cortex/docs/dun-and-bradstreet) module when SAP ECC or S/4 is selected.\n* **SAP**:\n  + The CDC script now considers the `L` flag alongside `I` and `U` when\n    determining which records are updated in the raw dataset. This is to account\n    for situations where the pipeline is somehow re-configured after data load,\n    but the CDC dataset can still be reused to avoid re-processing existing data.\n  + Column names in `StockInHand` views (ECC and S/4) for `MATNR` and\n    `WERKS` have been aligned with other views to be `MaterialNumber_MATNR`\n    and `Plant_WERKS`. Previous column names `ArticleNumber_MATNR` and\n    `Site_WERKS` still exist for compatibility reasons, but will be removed in\n    a future release. Customers are advised to change their upstream consumption assets accordingly.\n  + Column names in `SalesOrders_V2` views (ECC and S/4) for `ERDAT` and\n    `ERZET` have been aligned to new names `SalesDocumentCreationDate_ERDAT`,\n    `SalesOrderItemCreationDate_ERDAT`, `SalesOrderCreationTime_ERZET` and\n    `SalesDocumentItemCreationTime_ERZET` to account for the correct\n    granularity of their source table (either `VBAP` or `VBAK`) . Previous\n    column names `CreationDate_ERDAT` and `CreationTime_ERZET` still exist for\n    compatibility reasons, but will eventually be removed in a future release.\n    Customers are advised to change their upstream consumption assets\n    accordingly. Also, Sales Order Item level calendar dimensions are now added\n    by default.\n  + Column names in `Deliveries` view for `VGBEL`, `VGPOS`, and `XBLNR` are\n    updated to `InternalReferenceDocumentNumber_VGBEL`,\n    `InternalReferenceDocumentItem_VGPOS` `ExternalReferenceDocumentNumber_XBLNR`\n    for more clarity. Previous column names `SalesOrderNumber_VGBEL`,\n    `SalesOrderItem_VGPOS`, and `ReferenceDocumentNumber_XBLNR` still exist for\n    compatibility reasons, but will eventually be removed in a future release.\n    Customers are advised to change their upstream consumption assets\n    accordingly.\n  + Sales Order Item level calendar dimensions are now added by default.\n  + In `AccountingDocuments` view as well as the downstream\n    `AccountingDocumentsReceivables` views, `DoubtfulReceivables`, and\n    `DaysInArrear` metrics are now positive instead of negative to align with\n    [official SAP guidelines](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_S4HANA_ON-PREMISE/3cb1182b4a184bdd93f8d62e3f1f0741/39a73b581aee2160e10000000a44147b.html).\n  + `SalesFulfillment` and `SalesFulfillment_PerOrder` views are updated\n    to use `SalesOrders_V2` instead of `SalesOrders` view as their upstream\n    source for both ECC and S/4. The view signatures are unchanged.\n  + ERD for both [ECC](https://cloud.google.com/cortex/docs/operational-sap#sap-ecc) and\n    [S/4](https://cloud.google.com/cortex/docs/operational-sap#sap-s4-hana) have been cleaned up and\n    updated based on the latest changes.\n* **Marketing**: Cortex for Meridian reporting views adapted to TikTok, Meta,\n  and YouTube (DV360) to focus on top of the funnel marketing campaigns. Search\n  Ads data is skipped from aggregates as higher quality data is now available from\n  Marketing Mix Modeling (MMM) Data Platform.",
