### Feature

You can create alerting policies for new database resources and signals, using
filters to restrict the monitored metric data. This feature lets you get
detailed insights into the health of your database fleet and troubleshoot
issues. You can filter data based on metric labels, such as signal type, or by
resource labels, such as the resource's location or name. For more information,
see
[Metrics and alerting policy filters](https://cloud.google.com/database-center/docs/metrics).
