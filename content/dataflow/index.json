This improvement is available in recent Dataflow service releases, and is automatically enabled when using Dataflow Runner v2.\n\n**Note:** After this fix, pipelines that previously experienced data loss due to this issue might consume more resources (such as CPU, memory, and processing time) because more data is being processed.
