    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some of the metadata that is stored in Dataplex Universal Catalog is changing.
This change brings the metadata stored in Dataplex into consistency with
metadata from the original source systems such as Vertex AI, Bigtable, Spanner,
Pub/Sub, Dataform, and Dataproc Metastore. If you have workloads that depend on
such Dataplex metadata, you must adjust them to preserve continuity. For more
information about the scope of this change and what you need to do, see
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/dataplex/docs/metadata-changes">Changes to metadata stored in Dataplex Universal Catalog</a>.</p>]]></content>
    <summary>Metadata stored in Dataplex Universal Catalog is changing to align with source systems like Vertex AI and Bigtable. Workloads relying on this metadata may need adjustments to ensure continuity. Refer to the documentation for details on the scope and required actions.</summary>
