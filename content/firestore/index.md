### Feature

Firestore Enterprise edition now supports Native mode and the Pipeline operations interface.

Pipeline operations are a new query interface for Firestore.
This interface provides advanced query functionality that includes complex
expressions. It also adds support for many new functions like `min`, `max`,
`substring`, `regex_match` and `array_contains_all`.

With Firestore Enterprise edition in Native mode,
index creation is also completely optional, streamlining the process of developing new queries.

To learn more about Pipeline operations,
see the [query interfaces overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/firestore/native/docs/query-data/understanding-core-pipelines).

This feature is available in [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages).
