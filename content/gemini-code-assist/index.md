### Full Remote Codebase Awareness

Comprehensive understanding of your entire remote codebase directly within the
chat interface. This new capability improves the quality of suggestions and
answers to general questions about your project. To use it, ask an abstract
question about your remote context, such as "What does this repository do?" and
Gemini uses its deep knowledge of the codebase to provide a detailed and
accurate response. For more information, see
[Code customization overview](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/code-customization-overview).

### Get suggestions from your documentation stored in Markdown files

organization's internal documentation, stored in Markdown files. This means that
when you ask a question or request a code snippet, Gemini will use the context
available in your team's documentation to provide more accurate and tailored
responses, improving both the quality of the suggestions and the overall
relevance of the information you receive. To take advantage of this, ask a
question that is related to the context available in your remote Markdown files,
and Gemini will use that knowledge to assist you. For more information, see
[Code customization overview](https://cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/code-customization-overview).
