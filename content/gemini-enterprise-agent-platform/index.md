### Feature

**Gemini 3.5 Flash default model for Memory Bank**

The default model used for Memory Bank generation is now Gemini 3.5 Flash
instead of Gemini 2.5 Flash. For information, see
[Set up Memory Bank](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/scale/memory-bank/setup).

### Feature

**Semantic Governance Policies available in Public Preview**

Semantic Governance Policies (SGP) and the SGP engine are now available in [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). SGP provides an intelligent security and compliance layer that evaluates an AI agent's proposed tool calls against user intent and organizational business rules at runtime.

Key capabilities include:

* **Natural Language Constraints (NLC):** Author declarative business rules and security guardrails in plain English without needing to write code or redeploy agent applications.
* **Layered Intent Gating:** Intercepts agent tool calls at runtime to verify alignment with trusted user intent and prevent unauthorized actions, rogue tool use, and data exfiltration.
* **Granular Scoping:** Apply constraints globally across all tools for an agent or target specific tools and parameters (e.g., enforcing strict financial limits or geographic restrictions).
* **Agent Skills Lifecycle Governance:** Protects agents from context poisoning and supply-chain exploits by governing the dynamic loading of Agent Skills (tool packages) during sessions.
* **Dry Run Mode:** Test and observe policy verdicts in Log Explorer before enforcing them on active traffic.

For more information, see [Semantic governance policies overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/govern/policies/semantic-governance-overview).

### Change

**Supervised fine-tuning available for Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite and Gemini 3.5 Flash in Public Preview**

Supervised fine-tuning is now available for the `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` and
`gemini-3.5-flash` models in
[Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). Model tuning
for Gemini 3.1 Flash Lite and Gemini 3.5 Flash is restricted to `us-central1`
and `europe-west4` and tuned model serving is restricted to the `us` and `eu`
multi-region endpoints.

See [About supervised
fine-tuning](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/gemini-supervised-tuning)
for more information.

### Feature

**Provisioned Throughput support for supervised fine-tuned Gemini 3 model inference.**

Provisioned Throughput can be used to assure supervised fine-tuned inference using the same quota. Supervised fine-tuned inference for Gemini 3 models incurs a higher burndown rate compared to base model inference. Learn more [here](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/provisioned-throughput/supported-models#supervised-fine-tuned-model-support).

## 2026-06-18

### Feature

**Agent Gateway in General Availability**

Agent Gateway is the networking component of the Gemini
Enterprise Agent Platform ecosystem. It secures and governs connectivity for
all agentic interactions, whether they occur between users and agents,
agents and tools, or among agents themselves.

For details, see [Agent Gateway
overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/govern/gateways/agent-gateway-overview).

### Feature

**Agent Observability is generally available (GA)**

This release provides visibility into the performance, behavior, and health of deployed agents and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers directly within the agent management workflow.

Key updates in this release include:

* **Default-On Tracing:** OpenTelemetry tracing is now enabled by default for newly deployed Agent Development Kit (ADK) agents on Agent Engine, simplifying the observability setup process without requiring manual configuration.
* **Storage Prioritization:** Google Cloud Storage (GCS) is the default storage choice in the Google Cloud Console, instead of Cloud Logging. We recommend that you store your multimodal prompt and response payloads in a Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket. This solution provides robust support for large payloads and it enables fine-grained lifecycle management.
* **Enhanced Tracing:** Inspect step-by-step session execution and view directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of trace spans.

For more information, see the following:

* [Observability overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/optimize/observability/overview)
* [View agent traces](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/optimize/observability/traces)
* [Set up tracing](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/scale/runtime/tracing)

### Feature

**Agent Registry is generally available (GA)**

Agent Registry is [generally available (GA)](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). Agent Registry is a centralized catalog for discovering and registering agents and Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

The following features are available in Agent Registry for the GA launch stage:

* **API v1 and client libraries:** The `v1` version of the Agent Registry API is available. Cloud client libraries are available in C#, Go, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, and Ruby.
* **A2A v1 support:** Agent Registry supports Agent-to-Agent (A2A) protocol version `1.0`, letting you explicitly declare transport endpoints and bindings inside the `supportedInterfaces` array, in addition to the existing `0.3` schema support.
* **Terraform support:** Terraform scripts for Application Default Credentials (ADC) have graduated to General Availability. You can use Terraform to configure and manage your agents, MCP servers, endpoints, and bindings.

**Known limitations:**

* **Access Transparency and Access Approval:** [Access Transparency](https://docs.cloud.google.com/assured-workloads/access-transparency/docs/overview) logs, which provide visibility into when Google personnel access your content, and [Access Approval](https://docs.cloud.google.com/assured-workloads/access-approval/docs/overview) controls aren't available for Agent Registry configurations.
* **Data Residency:** If you configure the [resource location constraint](https://docs.cloud.google.com/organization-policy/restrict-locations) in your organization policy, Agent Registry enforces the constraint when you register a resource. However, detective controls for data residency compliance reporting are limited.

For more information, see the [Agent Registry overview](https://docs.cloud.google.com/agent-registry/overview).

### Feature

The Agent Identity API (`agentidentity.googleapis.com`) is
available in [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages).
This new API replaces the legacy IAM Connectors API
(`iamconnectors.googleapis.com`) for managing auth providers and agent
identities.

During the preview migration period, both APIs operate side-by-side. Existing
auth providers are automatically mirrored to the new V2 resource hierarchy
(`authProviders/`), allowing you to migrate your IAM policies, agent code, and
client applications without downtime.

  (`gemini-embedding-2`) for General Availability.
* Release The [**Gemini Deep Research
  Agent**](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/agents/deep-research), a
  pre-built agent designed to help you plan, execute, and synthesize
  multi-step research tasks. It uses Gemini 3.1 Pro to bridge the gap between
  public web data and private enterprise context by simultaneously grounding
  research across three distinct, high-fidelity data streams.
* Release [**Agent Platform remote MCP
  server**](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/reference/use-agent-platform-mcp)
  for General Availability. Support for Model Context Protocol (MCP) use is
  available for Agent Platform.
* Change
  **Google Cloud console navigation**: The navigation menus under Agent
  Platform (formerly Vertex AI) and Data Analytics have been updated to
  centralize agentic products and features. Bookmarked links will continue to
  work via automatic redirects.
