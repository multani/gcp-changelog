### Announcement

**Gemini 2.5 Flash with Live API Native Audio Preview**

[**Gemini 2.5 Flash with Live API Native Audio**](cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-5-flash) (`gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-09-2025`) is available in [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). A single, unified model processes audio input and generates audio output directly, eliminating separate text-to-speech/speech-to-text conversions. This results in-low latency, high-quality, and incredibly human-like conversations. New features and capabilities include:

* **Improved Barge-in:** Interrupt Gemini more naturally and reliably, even in loud and noisy environments.
* **Robust Function Calling:** We've improved the triggering rate, allowing Gemini to successfully execute the functions you define with greater precision.
* **Accurate Transcription:** The accuracy of audio-to-text transcription has been significantly enhanced.
* **Seamless Multilingual Support:** Speak to Gemini in multiple languages, and it will effortlessly switch between them without any pre-configuration. Language is no longer a barrier!
* **Enhanced Audio Quality:** Experience a dramatically improved audio quality that truly feels like speaking with a person.
* **Proactive Audio:** Define Gemini's expertise and set conditions for when it should respond. Gemini can act as a "silent listener," only chiming in when the conversation touches upon its designated area of expertise.
* **Affective Dialog:** Gemini can adapt and adjust its generated voice to match the emotional tone of the speaker, creating more empathetic and natural interactions.

[Watch our comprehensive demo](https://youtu.be/ZsB33Tr-P3c) to see these features in action, including seamless language switching, expert mode, emotionally aware responses, memory recall, and interactive screen sharing for engineering tasks â€“ all demonstrated directly within Vertex AI Studio without writing a single line of code!
