### Security

On September 23, 2025, we discovered a technical issue in
the Vertex AI API that resulted in a limited amount of responses
being misrouted between recipients for certain third-party models
when using streaming requests. This issue is now resolved.
Google models, e.g. Gemini, were not impacted.

Some internal proxies did not properly handle HTTP requests that
have an `Expect: 100-continue` header, resulting in
a desynchronization in a streaming response connection, where
a response intended for one request was instead delivered as
the response for a subsequent request.

For more information, see
[Security bulletins](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/security-bulletins#gcp-2025-059).

### Announcement

**Gemini 2.5 Flash with Live API Native Audio Preview**

[**Gemini 2.5 Flash with Live API Native Audio**](cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-5-flash) (`gemini-live-2.5-flash-preview-native-audio-09-2025`) is available in [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). A single, unified model processes audio input and generates audio output directly, eliminating separate text-to-speech/speech-to-text conversions. This results in-low latency, high-quality, and incredibly human-like conversations. New features and capabilities include:

* **Improved Barge-in:** Interrupt Gemini more naturally and reliably, even in loud and noisy environments.
* **Robust Function Calling:** We've improved the triggering rate, allowing Gemini to successfully execute the functions you define with greater precision.
* **Accurate Transcription:** The accuracy of audio-to-text transcription has been significantly enhanced.
* **Seamless Multilingual Support:** Speak to Gemini in multiple languages, and it will effortlessly switch between them without any pre-configuration. Language is no longer a barrier!
* **Enhanced Audio Quality:** Experience a dramatically improved audio quality that truly feels like speaking with a person.
* **Proactive Audio:** Define Gemini's expertise and set conditions for when it should respond. Gemini can act as a "silent listener," only chiming in when the conversation touches upon its designated area of expertise.
* **Affective Dialog:** Gemini can adapt and adjust its generated voice to match the emotional tone of the speaker, creating more empathetic and natural interactions.

[Watch our comprehensive demo](https://youtu.be/ZsB33Tr-P3c) to see these features in action, including seamless language switching, expert mode, emotionally aware responses, memory recall, and interactive screen sharing for engineering tasks – all demonstrated directly within Vertex AI Studio without writing a single line of code!

See [Gemini 2.5 Flash-Lite](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models/gemini/2-5-flash-lite) for more information.

### Announcement

**Live API** is now available as a private general availability offering in the API and Vertex AI Studio. Reach out to your Google account team representative to request access.

See [Live API](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/live-api) for more information.

### Deprecated

**Preview endpoint availability and removal:** All existing Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro preview endpoints (listed below) will continue to be available with their current preview pricing until July 15, 2025. After this date, these preview endpoints will be shut down.

* `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`
* `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-05-20`
* `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-03-25`
* `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06`
* `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-06-05`

### Changed

**Updated pricing for Gemini 2.5 Flash GA:** The price for Gemini 2.5 Flash in GA will be adjusted to reflect its quality and unified output token pricing. This includes lower prices for thinking output, higher prices for non-thinking output. These pricing changes will take effect on the new GA endpoint as shared above. Preview pricing will only continue on existing preview endpoints for 30 days post-GA on **July 15, 2025**.

### Changed

**Provisioned Throughput (PT):** Once a model is GA, all new PT purchases will be for GA endpoints only. If you've purchased PT for a specific preview version, it will still work for that specific preview. However, you must [migrate the existing PT to the GA endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/provisioned-throughput/purchase-provisioned-throughput#change-order) or purchase new PT for the GA endpoint by **July 15, 2025**.

### Changed

**Updated preview endpoints:** Effective **June 19, 2025**, `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17` endpoint will serve the Gemini 2.5 Flash model version released on 05-20, which has been promoted to GA. Similarly, the `gemini-2.5-pro-preview-05-06` and `03-25` endpoints will serve the Gemini 2.5 Pro model version released on 06-05, also promoted to GA. This update ensures continuity during your transition.
