This is applicable to all SharePoint connectors created before August 21, 2025, that contain `file` entity types.\n\nAs a one-time solution, you can avoid duplication by either running a full sync manually or waiting for the next scheduled full sync. After performing the full sync, you can perform incremental syncs without generating any duplicate documents.",
