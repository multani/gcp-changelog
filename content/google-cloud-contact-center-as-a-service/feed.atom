<p>Agent desktop is now <a href="https://cloud.google.com/products?e=48754805&amp;hl=en#product-launch-stages">generally available (GA)</a>. Agent desktop is a customizable interface that provides agents quick access to the information and tools they need to handle customer sessions. The desktop layout includes the agent adapter as well as configurable panels that display information or tools. You can configure a distinct desktop layout for each session type: inbound calls, outbound calls, or chats. You can then can configure which desktop layout that an agent sees when they answer an inbound call, place an outbound call, or handle a chat. You can also configure announcements to communicate updates, alerts, and other important information directly to agents. For more information, see <a href="https://cloud.google.com/contact-center/ccai-platform/docs/agent-desktop-overview">Agent desktop</a>.</p>
<p>The agent desktop provides the following capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create desktop layouts</strong>. With agent desktop, you can create customized desktop layouts for different use cases for your human agents. These include receiving inbound calls, placing outbound calls, and handling chat sessions. Your layouts can contain call adapters, chat adapters, and wide variety of panels for other capabilities such as live transcripts, knowledge assist, disposition codes, and session data feeds. You can also configure custom panels to use as widgets that you can drag into panels. For more information, see <a href="https://cloud.google.com/contact-center/ccai-platform/docs/agent-desktop-create-desktop-layouts">Create desktop layouts</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Configure custom panels</strong>. A custom panel displays one or more URLs for external resources. These can be documentation, tools, or other resources. A custom panel appears as a widget in the desktop layout builder. Then, when you create desktop layouts, you can drag widgets into panels. For more information, see <a href="https://cloud.google.com/contact-center/ccai-platform/docs/agent-desktop-configure-widgets">Configure custom panels</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Use widgets</strong>. Widgets are containers of specific functionality that you can drag into panels in the desktop layout builder. The desktop layout builder comes with a number of pre-defined widgets, such as <strong>Session Data Feed</strong>, <strong>Dispostion Codes and Notes</strong>, <strong>Knowledge Assist</strong>, and <strong>Live Transcript</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Configure desktop layouts for agents</strong>. You can configure which desktop layout that agents see when they answer an inbound call, place an outbound call, or handle a chat. You can configure this globally, at the queue level, and at the team level. Queue-level layout settings take priority over global settings. Team-level settings take priority over both queue-level settings and default settings. For more information, see <a href="https://cloud.google.com/contact-center/ccai-platform/docs/agent-desktop-set-desktop-layouts">Configure desktop layouts for agents</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Configure announcements</strong>. With announcements, you can communicate updates, alerts, and other important information directly to agents. Announcements appear in the agent desktop as notification banners that persist until the agent dismisses them. Announcements also appear in the agent's announcement list. For more information, see <a href="https://cloud.google.com/contact-center/ccai-platform/docs/agent-desktop-configure-announcements">Configure announcements</a>.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
    <summary>Agent desktop is a customizable interface that provides agents quick access to the information and tools they need to handle customer sessions. You can configure desktop layouts for different session types like inbound calls, outbound calls, or chats, and use various widgets for enhanced functionality. Announcements can also be configured to communicate important updates directly to agents.</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following issues were addressed in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where incoming chats took precedence over the in-progress chat.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>User experience change</strong>: When a new chat appears in the agent adapter, it no longer takes focus away from the in-progress chat. The in-progress retains focus.
* Fixed a web SDK issue where sensitive data sent by an end-user was redacted for both the end-user and the agent, instead of just for the agent.
* Fixed an issue where the contact list in the agent adapter wouldn't load the full list of contacts.
* Fixed an issue where an agent clicking an email in the agent adapter returned an <strong>Email Not Found</strong> error.
* Fixed an issue where managers assigned to multiple teams were unable to view agent statistics for every team they were assigned to.
* Fixed an issue for ServiceNow users where <code>call_duration</code> was using the earliest <code>connected_at</code> time instead of the latest <code>connected_at</code> time, causing call durations to appear longer than they actually were.
* Fixed an issue in the <strong>Settings &gt; Developer Settings &gt; External Storage</strong> pane where language checkboxes were associated with the <strong>Co-browse Recordings</strong> checkbox instead of the <strong>Session Data Feed</strong> checkbox.</p>
<p><strong>Administrators</strong>: In the <strong>Settings &gt; Developer Settings &gt; External Storage</strong> pane, the languages checkboxes have moved from the <strong>Co-browse Recordings</strong> checkbox to the <strong>Session Data Feed</strong> checkbox.
* Fixed an issue where agent-initiated outbound calls were using the default number for the selected queue instead of the number chosen by the agent.
* Fixed an issue where the downloaded session chat data report contained an extra quotation mark.
* Fixed an issue where users received an email telling them to create a password after Single Sign-On (SSO) was turned on.
* Fixed an issue where SSO configuration settings in the user's instance were deleted after they turned off SSO.
* Fixed an issue where an administrator couldn't configure agent status restrictions without exposing them to agents.
* Fixed an issue where custom contact lists could only be replaced, and not removed, after they were assigned to a team.
* Fixed an issue where the inheritance indicator and <strong>Reset to parent</strong> button was missing from the queue level <strong>Contact List Management</strong> pane.
* Fixed an issue where the SMS and Web chat availability preferences in the agent adapter were the reverse of how they were configured.
* Fixed an issue where queue transfer restrictions were not saved after being configured.
* Fixed an issue that occured when a user attempted to name a new queue. The name field abruptly lost focus after the first character, forcing the user to enter the queue name again.
* Fixed an issue where creating an instance would time out and fail.
* Fixed an issue that prevented reports from being downloaded.
* Fixed an issue where the chat history for blended SMS sessions failed to save.
* Fixed an issue where the <strong>Transfer failed</strong> message didn't appear. This occurred when an agent failed to pick up a tranferred call before the transferred call expiration time expired.
* Fixed an issue where IVR call recordings failed to save or were corrupted. This resulted in recordings that were only one second long, were saved in the wrong format, or weren't saved at all.
* Fixed an issue where completed chat sessions appeared in the chats waiting area of agent desktop.
* Fixed an issue for CRM users with voicemails that are attached directly to tickets. An incorrect "External Storage must be configured" warning appeared when configuring voicemail options for IVR queues.
* Fixed an issue where transfer restrictions that were configured and saved for a web queue did not appear correctly the next time the <strong>Transfer Restrictions</strong> pane for that queue was viewed.
* Fixed an issue where the unread message count in the chat pane was inconsistent when viewing it from multiple browser tabs.
* Fixed an issue in virtual assistant reporting where the <code>finish_reason</code> property was incorrectly assigned to the <code>undefined</code> value. Now the <code>finish_reason</code> property is assigned to descriptive values that describe the reason for the conclusion of the chat session.
* Fixed an issue where PDF transcripts of chat sessions contained malformed links.
* Fixed an issue in historical reports where the fields in the <strong>Failed Reason Description</strong> column were blank.
* Fixed an issue where CSAT scores were missing from some advanced reporting dashboards.
* Fixed an issue for HubSpot users that caused long delays in case creation for inbound calls.
* Fixed an issue where the photo and video files that the agent provided in pre-session Smart Actions didn't appear in the CRM.
* Fixed an issue where agents in <code>Unavailable</code> status couldn't see waiting web chats.
* Fixed an issue where HTML was not rendering properly in virtual agent messages in the agent adapter
* Fixed an issue where agents were not switching into <code>Wrap-up Exceeded</code> status after a breakthrough call.
* Fixed an agent deskop issue where administrators were unable to assign announcements to some teams or agents.
* Fixed an agent desktop issue where agents couldn't copy text to the clipboard from an agent desktop custom panel.
* Fixed an agent desktop issue where the term "Anonymous User" wasn't being translated into French.
* Fixed an issue where the <code>UJET_ID</code> and <code>ANI</code> variables weren't passed correctly for SIP calls.
* Fixed an issue where the chat adapter froze when agents switched between chats.
* Fixed an issue on the <strong>Agents</strong> page of the Google Cloud CCaaS portal where administrators couldn't switch between session types.
* Fixed an issue where a newly added Agent Assist platform displayed as <code>Invalid</code> even though it was valid.
* Fixed an issue for Salesforce users where the call button didn't work when an agent attempted to call a number that was attached to a record for a previous call.
* Fixed an issue where audio files with accented characters in their file names failed to play back when using a storage proxy.
* Fixed an agent desktop issue where the <code>UJET_ID</code> variable in the custom URL for a custom panel wasn't being passed correctly.
* Fixed an issue where calls originating from a native campaign generated two CRM tickets for the same interaction.
* Fixed latency issues with web SDK Telnyx calls.
* Fixed an issue where outbound Bring Your Own Carrier (BYOC) calls used a number other than the one agents selected in the agent adapter.
* Fixed a Telnyx chatbot worker failure issue where background jobs related to call processing and chatbot escalations were failing and consuming excessive system resources.
* Fixed an issue where calls to the bulk user upload endpoint returned a success status even when the uploads failed.
* Fixed an issue in the chat waiting field of the agent desktop when multiple chats were in wrap-up. Instead of displaying <strong>Wrap-up in progress</strong> for all sessions in wrap-up, some sessions displayed <strong>Auto answered</strong>.
* Fixed an issue in the queue group dashboard where the <strong>Callbacks waiting</strong> tile incorrectly included callbacks that were completed, abandoned, or failed.
* Fixed an issue that caused inbound calls to disconnect if they were routed to an agent with a disabled microphone.
* Fixed an issue for HubSpot users where logging the "call started" event (<code>create_activity</code>) in the ticket was delayed.
* Fixed an issue that prevented transferred calls from being routed to available agents.
* Fixed an issue in the agent adapter for French (Canada) where where words weren't translated or were translated incorrectly.
* Fixed an issue in call queue reporting where the Failed Reason Description for voice-scheduled mobile calls was not appearing.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following issues were addressed in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where a blank error message box appeared in the agent adapter when a call connected.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the notification icon for a new message or event in the chat adapter didn't clear after the agent viewed the message or event.</li>
<li>~~Fixed a Conversational Insights issue where conversation recordings were split into a file for the human agent segment and a file for the virtual agent segment. Now all call segments are aggregated into a single recording file, which is more useful for conversational analysis.~~</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a single call was being reported as two separate calls after the following occurred: (1) A call was escalated from a virtual agent to a queue, (2) An agent clicked <strong>Answer</strong> in the agent adapter, and (3) The end-user hung up before the countdown was complete.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where agents were unsure whether their action of declining a call was taking effect. Now, after an agent declines a call, the <strong>Decline</strong> button changes to <strong>Declining...</strong>, the <strong>Answer</strong> button is deactivated, and a message displays indicating that the call was declined.</li>
<li>Fixed the message that appeared in the agent adapter when an agent left a multi-party session. Instead of saying that the session will be tranferred to the remaining agents(s), the message now says that the session will be transferred to the remaining participant(s). This is because the remaining participants might not be agents.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where administators were unable to monitor or barge into calls.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the <strong>Decline</strong> button didn't display or didn't work correctly in the agent adapter when the following occurred: (1) An agent was in an active call, and (2) The agent received a second call on their direct number.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where clearing the <strong>Play Call Recording Message</strong> checkbox in <strong>Settings &gt; Call &gt; Call Details</strong> pane didn't work if the queue was configured for human agents and virtual agents or virtual agents only.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the <strong>Transfer failed</strong> error message failed to appear in the call adapter after the following occured: a transferred call wasn't answered before the unanswered call expiration time expired.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where an agent on a team that was assigned to a queue wasn't able to select their desired queue to make an outbound call. We also improved the text at <strong>Settings &gt; Call &gt; Call Details &gt; Queue Selection for Outbound Call</strong> to better describe the call adapter behavior.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the missed chat message didn't appear after the missed chat threshold expired.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where end-users were unable to download chat transcripts containing special characters, emoji, or redacted content.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the web SDK where configuring custom system messages with empty quotes or NULL values didn't fully suppress the messages.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the web SDK where some non-English characters in downloaded chat transcripts were appearing as question marks.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Hubspot where recordings of transferred calls were failing to save.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Salesforce where the <strong>Call</strong> button in the call adapter wasn't working for outbound calls to a phone number that was associated with a previous record.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the data in reports didn't match the data in the dashboards.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where virtual agent calls using Dialogflow CX failed, ending unexpectedly.</li>
<li>Fixed two cross-site scripting vulnerabilites in the agent adapter.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where deltacast selected the agent with the longest time in the Available status instead of the agent with the longest time since their last customer interaction.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where escalations from a virtual agent to a human agent failed, and audio from the last agent response before human agent escalation was truncated.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where transcriptions weren't being created for IVR calls.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where agents could become stuck in wrap-up status, particularly with concurrent calls or quick callbacks.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
    <summary>This release addresses various issues, including problems with error messages, notification icons, call handling, agent status visibility, and data discrepancies. Enhancements were made to call recording aggregation, agent status updates, and multi-party session messaging. Specific fixes were implemented for chat transcript downloads, web SDK behavior, and integrations with Hubspot and Salesforce. Additionally, security vulnerabilities and issues with virtual agent escalations and call transcriptions have been resolved.</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Salesforce ICU Update</strong></p>
<p>This is for Google Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) customers that use Salesforce integration with CCaaS.</p>
<p>On <strong>June 15th, 2025</strong>, Salesforce is rolling out an automatic upgrade to its International Components for Unicode (ICU) locale data. This affects how date, time, number, and currency formatting are handled across Apex, Visualforce, and Lightning components.</p>
<p>This change affects Salesforce integrations that are using Apex API versions earlier than 45.0. These integrations use the legacy Java locale behavior, which could cause formatting discrepancies, incorrect parsing, or runtime errors.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Google has reviewed the CCaaS managed package and has updated the impacted classes to use safe, ICU-compatible parsing and formatting methods. This includes cleaning up legacy code that uses older API versions, which might affect this transition.</p>
<p>The following table shows the affected classes:</p>
<p><strong>Affected classes</strong></p>
<p>| Name | API version |
| --- | --- |
| <code>UJETUtilsController</code> | 35.0 |
| <code>UJETUtilsControllerTests</code> | 35.0 |
| <code>UJETJWT</code> | 43.0 |
| <code>UJETJWTTests</code> | 43.0 |
| <code>UJETPageController</code> | 43.0 |</p>
<p><strong>Required action</strong></p>
<p>To ensure compatibility with the Salesforce ICU update and prevent any operational impact, you must complete the following action before <strong>June 15th, 2025</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the <a href="https://login.salesforce.com/?ec=302&amp;startURL=%2Fpackaging%2FinstallPackage.apexp%3Fp0%3D04tKk0000011MNw%26InstHostname%3Dlogin.salesforce.com">v1.40 update</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This installation updates the affected classes. No further action is required.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if you don't upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>If any part of your integration or Apex code uses versions earlier than 45.0 after June 15th, Salesforce will not apply the ICU formatting to those sections. This could potentially lead to issues, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorrect date and time parsing</li>
<li>Unexpected errors in workflows or automations</li>
<li>Mismatch between Lightning and Classic behavior</li>
<li>Breakage in integrations expecting consistent locale handling</li>
</ul>
<p>Google considers the affected classes in CC_AGENT_APP v1.38 to be safe. While some of the affected classes have legacy methods that are affected by this update, they are not being actively used and will be deprecated in version 1.40. Regardless, Google still recommends installing the v1.40 update. Not upgrading can potentially impact other solutions that are installed on the environment, as described in this communication.</p>
<p><strong>Defer the update</strong></p>
<p>As described in <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.icu_migration_enable.htm&amp;type=5">Enable the ICU Locale Formats</a>, you can defer the automatic rollout of this update.</p>
<p>To defer this update, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the Quick Find search box in <strong>Setup</strong>, enter <strong>User Interface</strong>.</li>
<li>On the User Interface page, deselect the <strong>Enable ICU locale formats as part of the scheduled rollout</strong> checkbox.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: This will only be effective if completed before <strong>June 15th 2025</strong>.</p>]]></content>
    <summary>Salesforce is upgrading its ICU locale data on June 15th, 2025. This may affect Google CCaaS customers using Salesforce integration with Apex API versions earlier than 45.0, potentially causing formatting discrepancies or errors. Google has updated its managed package to ensure compatibility. To prevent issues, install the v1.40 update before June 15th, 2025. Failure to upgrade may lead to incorrect parsing, unexpected errors, and integration breakages.</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following issues were addressed in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where calls weren't being assigned to the correct agent in Google Cloud CCaaS reporting.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where calls weren't being assigned to the correct agent in the CRM.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the communication between a virtual task assistant and an end-user was not included in the Agent Assist live transcript in the agent adapter.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where agent outbound calls generated incorrect URLs in reporting. URLs contained <code>ticket</code> instead of <code>tickets</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where newly created global contact list destinations were not available in the <strong>Overcapacity Deflection</strong> settings for IVR queues.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the <code>on_email_thread_created</code> event listener was mistakenly logging customer names and email addresses.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where uploading a new overcapacity deflection message didn't replace the existing message.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where agents were not being assigned chat sessions while routing was configured for deltacast.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where attachments were lost when: (1) A chat session was transfered to another agent, or (2) After a chat auto-dismissed, an end-user restarted the chat with the same agent in the same queue.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where chats didn't time out after being inactive for longer than the chat timeout setting for the queue.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where agents who were removed from a chat session using the <strong>Connected Chats</strong> page were not fully disconnected from the session. These agents remained in the conversation tile, couldn't remove themselves from the session, and couldn't receive new chats.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where chats initiated outside of working hours generated incorrect chat transcripts. Instead of indicating that the support center was closed, the transcipts indicated that customer support was experiencing high volume.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where an external agent and an end-user couldn't communicate after an internal agent did the following: (1) Answered the call, (2) Put the end-user on hold, (3) tranferred the call to a queue with auto redirect to an external number, and (4) failed to release the hold before leaving the call.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where end-users with a blocked phone number were able to contact support using chat.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the global disposition list appeared in the chat adapter during wrap-up instead of the disposition list for the agent's queue.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a barge-in event interrupted an agent's audio.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where call session recordings were either not being sent to external storage or they were sent in the wrong file format.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in advanced reporting dashboards where chats appeared in the chat waiting menu even after the chat sessions ended.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the agent desktop translations in French (Canada) and Japanese were not complete.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the system was generating duplicate After Call Work records for a single wrap-up.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where bulk upload containing new users assigned to teams failed.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
    <summary>Several issues have been resolved, including problems with call routing and agent assignment in CCaaS reporting and CRM, incorrect URL generation for agent outbound calls, and issues with overcapacity deflection settings. Additionally, fixes were made for chat session handling, including lost attachments, incorrect chat timeouts, and agent disconnections. The update also addresses problems with call recordings, reporting dashboards, agent desktop translations, duplicate After Call Work records, and bulk user upload failures.</summary>
