    <updated>2025-07-10T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following issues were addressed in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where a blank error message box appeared in the agent adapter when a call connected.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the notification icon for a new message or event in the chat adapter didn't clear after the agent viewed the message or event.</li>
<li>Fixed a Conversational Insights issue where conversation recordings were split into a file for the human agent segment and a file for the virtual agent segment. Now all call segments are aggregated into a single recording file, which is more useful for conversational analysis.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a single call was being reported as two separate calls after the following occurred: (1) A call was escalated from a virtual agent to a queue, (2) An agent clicked <strong>Answer</strong> in the agent adapter, and (3) The end-user hung up before the countdown was complete.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where agents were unsure whether their action of declining a call was taking effect. Now, after an agent declines a call, the <strong>Decline</strong> button changes to <strong>Declining...</strong>, the <strong>Answer</strong> button is deactivated, and a message displays indicating that the call was declined.</li>
<li>Fixed the message that appeared in the agent adapter when an agent left a multi-party session. Instead of saying that the session will be tranferred to the remaining agents(s), the message now says that the session will be transferred to the remaining participant(s). This is because the remaining participants might not be agents.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where administators were unable to monitor or barge into calls.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the <strong>Decline</strong> button didn't display or didn't work correctly in the agent adapter when the following occurred: (1) An agent was in an active call, and (2) The agent received a second call on their direct number.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where clearing the <strong>Play Call Recording Message</strong> checkbox in <strong>Settings &gt; Call &gt; Call Details</strong> pane didn't work if the queue was configured for human agents and virtual agents or virtual agents only.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the <strong>Transfer failed</strong> error message failed to appear in the call adapter after the following occured: a transferred call wasn't answered before the unanswered call expiration time expired.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where an agent on a team that was assigned to a queue wasn't able to select their desired queue to make an outbound call. We also improved the text at <strong>Settings &gt; Call &gt; Call Details &gt; Queue Selection for Outbound Call</strong> to better describe the call adapter behavior.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the missed chat message didn't appear after the missed chat threshold expired.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where end-users were unable to download chat transcripts containing special characters, emoji, or redacted content.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the web SDK where configuring custom system messages with empty quotes or NULL values didn't fully suppress the messages.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with the web SDK where some non-English characters in downloaded chat transcripts were appearing as question marks.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Hubspot where recordings of transferred calls were failing to save.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Salesforce where the <strong>Call</strong> button in the call adapter wasn't working for outbound calls to a phone number that was associated with a previous record.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the data in reports didn't match the data in the dashboards.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where virtual agent calls using Dialogflow CX failed, ending unexpectedly.</li>
<li>Fixed two cross-site scripting vulnerabilites in the agent adapter.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where deltacast selected the agent with the longest time in the Available status instead of the agent with the longest time since their last customer interaction.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where escalations from a virtual agent to a human agent failed, and audio from the last agent response before human agent escalation was truncated.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where transcriptions weren't being created for IVR calls.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
    <summary>This release addresses various issues, including problems with error messages, notification icons, call recordings, call reporting, and the agent adapter's functionality. Enhancements were made to call handling, chat transcript downloads, and data consistency across reports and dashboards. Security vulnerabilities were also resolved.</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Salesforce ICU Update</strong></p>
<p>This is for Google Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) customers that use Salesforce integration with CCaaS.</p>
<p>On <strong>June 15th, 2025</strong>, Salesforce is rolling out an automatic upgrade to its International Components for Unicode (ICU) locale data. This affects how date, time, number, and currency formatting are handled across Apex, Visualforce, and Lightning components.</p>
<p>This change affects Salesforce integrations that are using Apex API versions earlier than 45.0. These integrations use the legacy Java locale behavior, which could cause formatting discrepancies, incorrect parsing, or runtime errors.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Google has reviewed the CCaaS managed package and has updated the impacted classes to use safe, ICU-compatible parsing and formatting methods. This includes cleaning up legacy code that uses older API versions, which might affect this transition.</p>
<p>The following table shows the affected classes:</p>
<p><strong>Affected classes</strong></p>
<p>| Name | API version |
| --- | --- |
| <code>UJETUtilsController</code> | 35.0 |
| <code>UJETUtilsControllerTests</code> | 35.0 |
| <code>UJETJWT</code> | 43.0 |
| <code>UJETJWTTests</code> | 43.0 |
| <code>UJETPageController</code> | 43.0 |</p>
<p><strong>Required action</strong></p>
<p>To ensure compatibility with the Salesforce ICU update and prevent any operational impact, you must complete the following action before <strong>June 15th, 2025</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the <a href="https://login.salesforce.com/?ec=302&amp;startURL=%2Fpackaging%2FinstallPackage.apexp%3Fp0%3D04tKk0000011MNw%26InstHostname%3Dlogin.salesforce.com">v1.40 update</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This installation updates the affected classes. No further action is required.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if you don't upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>If any part of your integration or Apex code uses versions earlier than 45.0 after June 15th, Salesforce will not apply the ICU formatting to those sections. This could potentially lead to issues, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorrect date and time parsing</li>
<li>Unexpected errors in workflows or automations</li>
<li>Mismatch between Lightning and Classic behavior</li>
<li>Breakage in integrations expecting consistent locale handling</li>
</ul>
<p>Google considers the affected classes in CC_AGENT_APP v1.38 to be safe. While some of the affected classes have legacy methods that are affected by this update, they are not being actively used and will be deprecated in version 1.40. Regardless, Google still recommends installing the v1.40 update. Not upgrading can potentially impact other solutions that are installed on the environment, as described in this communication.</p>
<p><strong>Defer the update</strong></p>
<p>As described in <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.icu_migration_enable.htm&amp;type=5">Enable the ICU Locale Formats</a>, you can defer the automatic rollout of this update.</p>
<p>To defer this update, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the Quick Find search box in <strong>Setup</strong>, enter <strong>User Interface</strong>.</li>
<li>On the User Interface page, deselect the <strong>Enable ICU locale formats as part of the scheduled rollout</strong> checkbox.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: This will only be effective if completed before <strong>June 15th 2025</strong>.</p>]]></content>
    <summary>Salesforce is upgrading its ICU locale data on June 15th, 2025. This may affect Google CCaaS customers using Salesforce integration with Apex API versions earlier than 45.0, potentially causing formatting discrepancies or errors. Google has updated its managed package to ensure compatibility. To prevent issues, install the v1.40 update before June 15th, 2025. Failure to upgrade may lead to incorrect parsing, unexpected errors, and integration breakages.</summary>

<li>Fixed an issue where chats initiated outside of working hours generated incorrect chat transcripts. Instead of indicating that the support center was closed, the transcipts indicated that customer support was experiencing high volume.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where an external agent and an end-user couldn't communicate after an internal agent did the following: (1) Answered the call, (2) Put the end-user on hold, (3) tranferred the call to a queue with auto redirect to an external number, and (4) failed to release the hold before leaving the call.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where the agent desktop translations in French (Canada) and Japanese were not complete.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the system was generating duplicate After Call Work records for a single wrap-up.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where bulk upload containing new users assigned to teams failed.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
    <summary>Several issues have been resolved, including problems with call routing and agent assignment in CCaaS reporting and CRM, incorrect URL generation for agent outbound calls, and issues with overcapacity deflection settings.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following issues were addressed in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where calls were were being logged as <strong>Call with unknown contact</strong> in HubSpot instead of under the correct contact name.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the client secret couldn't be saved when a user attempted to set up authentication (using either basic authentication or OAuth) for a custom CRM with the <strong>Generic API</strong> CRM lookup method.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the setup dialog for <strong>Find an account by query endpoint</strong> could not be reached due to an authentication error when configuring OAuth for a custom CRM.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where calls were being passed to a custom CRM with the incorrect phone number format.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue for ServiceNow users where records were created for outbound calls despite the agent selecting <strong>Do not create a record</strong> in the call adapter.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where a queue did not have access to the global contact list even though it was configured to have access to it.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the <strong>Directory</strong> tab didn't appear when an agent was transferring a call.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the <strong>Voice Campaign</strong> checkbox didn't appear for <strong>Select Call Types</strong> in the <strong>Create Reports</strong> pane, despite the user having the appropriate report access permissions.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where agent extension deflection recordings didn't upload after appearing to be successfully uploaded.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that occurred when the <code>@{NEXT_REOPEN_HOUR}</code> dynamic variable was put in the <strong>Message</strong> field for <strong>After Hour Messaging</strong> in the <strong>Web &amp; Mobile Messages</strong> pane. The variable always resolved as the next time the chat queue opened on the <em>following</em> day. This happened even when the next time the chat queue opened was on the <em>current</em> day.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that occurred when an end-user on the global contact list placed an inbound call to a queue with access to the global contact list turned off. The agent adapter displayed the destination name of the caller, despite access to the global contact list being turned off.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where the "next open hours" message was incorrect when a chat ended after midnight.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the call transcript failed to continue after an agent returned from hold.</li>

<li>Fixed an issue where a user with a manager role received a "Not Authorized" error when attempting to use the <strong>Operation Management</strong> and <strong>Disposition Codes</strong> pages.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the <code>failReason</code> and <code>afterHours</code> fields in the session metadata file were incorrect for chats that failed because they were attempted after hours.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the <strong>Assign agents</strong> button wasn't working for custom after hours deflection and automatic redirection.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the client secret was not saved when configuring OAuth for a custom CRM.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where calling the current queue status endpoint of the Manager API intermittently returned a 404 error.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the wrong disposition code list appeared for an agent after transferring a chat to an agent in a different queue.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where chat shortcuts were not working in the agent adapter for mobile chats.</li>
<li>Fixed issues where agents were unable to successfully move beyond the wrap-up state to handle the next call.</li>
