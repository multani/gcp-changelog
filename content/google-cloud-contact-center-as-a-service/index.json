We also improved the text at **Settings > Call > Call Details > Queue Selection for Outbound Call** to better describe the call adapter behavior.\n* Fixed an issue where the missed chat message didn't appear after the missed chat threshold expired.\n* Fixed an issue where end-users were unable to download chat transcripts containing special characters, emoji, or redacted content.\n* Fixed an issue with the web SDK where configuring custom system messages with empty quotes or NULL values didn't fully suppress the messages.\n* Fixed an issue with the web SDK where some non-English characters in downloaded chat transcripts were appearing as question marks.\n* Fixed an issue in Salesforce where the **Call** button in the call adapter wasn't working for outbound calls to a phone number that was associated with a previous record.",

        "content": "**Salesforce ICU Update**\n\nThis is for Google Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) customers that use Salesforce integration with CCaaS.\n\nOn **June 15th, 2025**, Salesforce is rolling out an automatic upgrade to its International Components for Unicode (ICU) locale data. This affects how date, time, number, and currency formatting are handled across Apex, Visualforce, and Lightning components.\n\nThis change affects Salesforce integrations that are using Apex API versions earlier than 45.0. These integrations use the legacy Java locale behavior, which could cause formatting discrepancies, incorrect parsing, or runtime errors.\n\n**Solution**\n\nGoogle has reviewed the CCaaS managed package and has updated the impacted classes to use safe, ICU-compatible parsing and formatting methods. This includes cleaning up legacy code that uses older API versions, which might affect this transition.\n\nThe following table shows the affected classes:\n\n**Affected classes**\n\n| Name | API version |\n| --- | --- |\n| `UJETUtilsController` | 35.0 |\n| `UJETUtilsControllerTests` | 35.0 |\n| `UJETJWT` | 43.0 |\n| `UJETJWTTests` | 43.0 |\n| `UJETPageController` | 43.0 |\n\n**Required action**\n\nTo ensure compatibility with the Salesforce ICU update and prevent any operational impact, you must complete the following action before **June 15th, 2025**:\n\n* Install the [v1.40 update](https://login.salesforce.com/?ec=302&startURL=%2Fpackaging%2FinstallPackage.apexp%3Fp0%3D04tKk0000011MNw%26InstHostname%3Dlogin.salesforce.com).\n\nThis installation updates the affected classes. No further action is required.\n\n**What happens if you don't upgrade?**\n\nIf any part of your integration or Apex code uses versions earlier than 45.0 after June 15th, Salesforce will not apply the ICU formatting to those sections. This could potentially lead to issues, including the following:\n\n* Incorrect date and time parsing\n* Unexpected errors in workflows or automations\n* Mismatch between Lightning and Classic behavior\n* Breakage in integrations expecting consistent locale handling\n\nGoogle considers the affected classes in CC\\_AGENT\\_APP v1.38 to be safe. While some of the affected classes have legacy methods that are affected by this update, they are not being actively used and will be deprecated in version 1.40. Regardless, Google still recommends installing the v1.40 update. Not upgrading can potentially impact other solutions that are installed on the environment, as described in this communication.\n\n**Defer the update**\n\nAs described in [Enable the ICU Locale Formats](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.icu_migration_enable.htm&type=5), you can defer the automatic rollout of this update.\n\nTo defer this update, follow these steps:\n\n1. From the Quick Find search box in **Setup**, enter **User Interface**.\n2. On the User Interface page, deselect the **Enable ICU locale formats as part of the scheduled rollout** checkbox.\n\n**Important**: This will only be effective if completed before **June 15th 2025**.",
