The name field abruptly lost focus after the first character, forcing the user to enter the queue name again.\n* Fixed an issue where creating an instance would time out and fail.\n* Fixed an issue that prevented reports from being downloaded.\n* Fixed an issue where the chat history for blended SMS sessions failed to save.\n* Fixed an issue where the **Transfer failed** message didn't appear. This occurred when an agent failed to pick up a tranferred call before the transferred call expiration time expired.\n* Fixed an issue where IVR call recordings failed to save or were corrupted. This resulted in recordings that were only one second long, were saved in the wrong format, or weren't saved at all.\n* Fixed an issue where completed chat sessions appeared in the chats waiting area of agent desktop.\n* Fixed an issue for CRM users with voicemails that are attached directly to tickets. An incorrect \"External Storage must be configured\" warning appeared when configuring voicemail options for IVR queues.\n* Fixed an issue where transfer restrictions that were configured and saved for a web queue did not appear correctly the next time the **Transfer Restrictions** pane for that queue was viewed.\n* Fixed an issue where the unread message count in the chat pane was inconsistent when viewing it from multiple browser tabs.\n* Fixed an issue in virtual assistant reporting where the `finish_reason` property was incorrectly assigned to the `undefined` value. Now the `finish_reason` property is assigned to descriptive values that describe the reason for the conclusion of the chat session.\n* Fixed an issue where PDF transcripts of chat sessions contained malformed links.\n* Fixed an issue in historical reports where the fields in the **Failed Reason Description** column were blank.\n* Fixed an issue where CSAT scores were missing from some advanced reporting dashboards.\n* Fixed an issue for HubSpot users that caused long delays in case creation for inbound calls.\n* Fixed an issue where the photo and video files that the agent provided in pre-session Smart Actions didn't appear in the CRM.\n* Fixed an issue where agents in `Unavailable` status couldn't see waiting web chats.\n* Fixed an issue where HTML was not rendering properly in virtual agent messages in the agent adapter\n* Fixed an issue where agents were not switching into `Wrap-up Exceeded` status after a breakthrough call.\n* Fixed an agent deskop issue where administrators were unable to assign announcements to some teams or agents.\n* Fixed an agent desktop issue where agents couldn't copy text to the clipboard from an agent desktop custom panel.\n* Fixed an agent desktop issue where the term \"Anonymous User\" wasn't being translated into French.\n* Fixed an issue where the `UJET_ID` and `ANI` variables weren't passed correctly for SIP calls.\n* Fixed an issue where the chat adapter froze when agents switched between chats.\n* Fixed an issue on the **Agents** page of the Google Cloud CCaaS portal where administrators couldn't switch between session types.\n* Fixed an issue where a newly added Agent Assist platform displayed as `Invalid` even though it was valid.\n* Fixed an issue for Salesforce users where the call button didn't work when an agent attempted to call a number that was attached to a record for a previous call.\n* Fixed an issue where audio files with accented characters in their file names failed to play back when using a storage proxy.\n* Fixed an agent desktop issue where the `UJET_ID` variable in the custom URL for a custom panel wasn't being passed correctly.\n* Fixed an issue where calls originating from a native campaign generated two CRM tickets for the same interaction.\n* Fixed latency issues with web SDK Telnyx calls.\n* Fixed an issue where outbound Bring Your Own Carrier (BYOC) calls used a number other than the one agents selected in the agent adapter.\n* Fixed a Telnyx chatbot worker failure issue where background jobs related to call processing and chatbot escalations were failing and consuming excessive system resources.",

Now all call segments are aggregated into a single recording file, which is more useful for conversational analysis.\n* Fixed an issue where a single call was being reported as two separate calls after the following occurred: (1) A call was escalated from a virtual agent to a queue, (2) An agent clicked **Answer** in the agent adapter, and (3) The end-user hung up before the countdown was complete.\n* Fixed an issue where agents were unsure whether their action of declining a call was taking effect. Now, after an agent declines a call, the **Decline** button changes to **Declining...**, the **Answer** button is deactivated, and a message displays indicating that the call was declined.\n* Fixed the message that appeared in the agent adapter when an agent left a multi-party session.

We also improved the text at **Settings > Call > Call Details > Queue Selection for Outbound Call** to better describe the call adapter behavior.\n* Fixed an issue where the missed chat message didn't appear after the missed chat threshold expired.\n* Fixed an issue where end-users were unable to download chat transcripts containing special characters, emoji, or redacted content.\n* Fixed an issue with the web SDK where configuring custom system messages with empty quotes or NULL values didn't fully suppress the messages.\n* Fixed an issue with the web SDK where some non-English characters in downloaded chat transcripts were appearing as question marks.\n* Fixed an issue in Hubspot where recordings of transferred calls were failing to save.\n* Fixed an issue in Salesforce where the **Call** button in the call adapter wasn't working for outbound calls to a phone number that was associated with a previous record.\n* Fixed an issue where the data in reports didn't match the data in the dashboards.\n* Fixed an issue where virtual agent calls using Dialogflow CX failed, ending unexpectedly.\n* Fixed two cross-site scripting vulnerabilites in the agent adapter.\n* Fixed an issue where deltacast selected the agent with the longest time in the Available status instead of the agent with the longest time since their last customer interaction.\n* Fixed an issue where escalations from a virtual agent to a human agent failed, and audio from the last agent response before human agent escalation was truncated.\n* Fixed an issue where transcriptions weren't being created for IVR calls.\n* Fixed an issue where agents could become stuck in wrap-up status, particularly with concurrent calls or quick callbacks.",

Now all call segments are aggregated into a single recording file, which is more useful for conversational analysis.\n* Fixed an issue where a single call was being reported as two separate calls after the following occurred: (1) A call was escalated from a virtual agent to a queue, (2) An agent clicked **Answer** in the agent adapter, and (3) The end-user hung up before the countdown was complete.\n* Fixed an issue where agents were unsure whether their action of declining a call was taking effect. Now, after an agent declines a call, the **Decline** button changes to **Declining...**, the **Answer** button is deactivated, and a message displays indicating that the call was declined.\n* Fixed the message that appeared in the agent adapter when an agent left a multi-party session. Instead of saying that the session will be tranferred to the remaining agents(s), the message now says that the session will be transferred to the remaining participant(s).

We also improved the text at **Settings > Call > Call Details > Queue Selection for Outbound Call** to better describe the call adapter behavior.\n* Fixed an issue where the missed chat message didn't appear after the missed chat threshold expired.\n* Fixed an issue where end-users were unable to download chat transcripts containing special characters, emoji, or redacted content.\n* Fixed an issue with the web SDK where configuring custom system messages with empty quotes or NULL values didn't fully suppress the messages.\n* Fixed an issue with the web SDK where some non-English characters in downloaded chat transcripts were appearing as question marks.\n* Fixed an issue in Hubspot where recordings of transferred calls were failing to save.\n* Fixed an issue in Salesforce where the **Call** button in the call adapter wasn't working for outbound calls to a phone number that was associated with a previous record.\n* Fixed an issue where the data in reports didn't match the data in the dashboards.\n* Fixed an issue where virtual agent calls using Dialogflow CX failed, ending unexpectedly.\n* Fixed two cross-site scripting vulnerabilites in the agent adapter.\n* Fixed an issue where deltacast selected the agent with the longest time in the Available status instead of the agent with the longest time since their last customer interaction.\n* Fixed an issue where escalations from a virtual agent to a human agent failed, and audio from the last agent response before human agent escalation was truncated.\n* Fixed an issue where transcriptions weren't being created for IVR calls.",

        "content": "**Salesforce ICU Update**\n\nThis is for Google Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) customers that use Salesforce integration with CCaaS.\n\nOn **June 15th, 2025**, Salesforce is rolling out an automatic upgrade to its International Components for Unicode (ICU) locale data. This affects how date, time, number, and currency formatting are handled across Apex, Visualforce, and Lightning components.\n\nThis change affects Salesforce integrations that are using Apex API versions earlier than 45.0. These integrations use the legacy Java locale behavior, which could cause formatting discrepancies, incorrect parsing, or runtime errors.\n\n**Solution**\n\nGoogle has reviewed the CCaaS managed package and has updated the impacted classes to use safe, ICU-compatible parsing and formatting methods. This includes cleaning up legacy code that uses older API versions, which might affect this transition.\n\nThe following table shows the affected classes:\n\n**Affected classes**\n\n| Name | API version |\n| --- | --- |\n| `UJETUtilsController` | 35.0 |\n| `UJETUtilsControllerTests` | 35.0 |\n| `UJETJWT` | 43.0 |\n| `UJETJWTTests` | 43.0 |\n| `UJETPageController` | 43.0 |\n\n**Required action**\n\nTo ensure compatibility with the Salesforce ICU update and prevent any operational impact, you must complete the following action before **June 15th, 2025**:\n\n* Install the [v1.40 update](https://login.salesforce.com/?ec=302&startURL=%2Fpackaging%2FinstallPackage.apexp%3Fp0%3D04tKk0000011MNw%26InstHostname%3Dlogin.salesforce.com).\n\nThis installation updates the affected classes. No further action is required.\n\n**What happens if you don't upgrade?**\n\nIf any part of your integration or Apex code uses versions earlier than 45.0 after June 15th, Salesforce will not apply the ICU formatting to those sections. This could potentially lead to issues, including the following:\n\n* Incorrect date and time parsing\n* Unexpected errors in workflows or automations\n* Mismatch between Lightning and Classic behavior\n* Breakage in integrations expecting consistent locale handling\n\nGoogle considers the affected classes in CC\\_AGENT\\_APP v1.38 to be safe. While some of the affected classes have legacy methods that are affected by this update, they are not being actively used and will be deprecated in version 1.40. Regardless, Google still recommends installing the v1.40 update. Not upgrading can potentially impact other solutions that are installed on the environment, as described in this communication.\n\n**Defer the update**\n\nAs described in [Enable the ICU Locale Formats](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.icu_migration_enable.htm&type=5), you can defer the automatic rollout of this update.\n\nTo defer this update, follow these steps:\n\n1. From the Quick Find search box in **Setup**, enter **User Interface**.\n2. On the User Interface page, deselect the **Enable ICU locale formats as part of the scheduled rollout** checkbox.\n\n**Important**: This will only be effective if completed before **June 15th 2025**.",
