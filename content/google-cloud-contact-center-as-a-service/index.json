This prevented the campaigns from completing successfully.\n* Fixed an issue in the **Call Details** pane where the **Recording Message Sequence** settings were incorrectly inactive when the **Play Call Recording Messages** checkboxes were cleared.\n\n  Administrators: In the **Call Details** pane, we changed **Recording Message Sequence** to **Recording Message Sequence for Outbound Calls** for clarity.\n* Fixed an issue where the customized greeting for an automatic redirection rule didn't play for calls that entered the queue using a Direct Access Phone (DAP) number.\n* Fixed an issue that occurred when a call was made from the global contact list. On the **Details** tab of the call adapter, the destination name didn't display. Instead, the destination phone number displayed.\n* Fixed an agent desktop issue where an agent status that was configured with a role restriction mistakenly appeared in the status list for a user assigned to that restricted role.\n* Fixed an issue where searching for an inbound-only queue on the **Phone Number Management** page failed to return a result.\n* Fixed an issue that caused queue duration and wait duration to be reported as `0`. This occurred when the **Call Service Level Target** on a queue settings page was set to a number that exceeded the maximum allowed limit.\n* Fixed an issue where a team assigned to a preference profile added only 1 user to the profile's users count, instead of adding the total number of users on the team.\n* Fixed an issue where agents were timed out for inactivity while composing an email in the email adapter.\n* Fixed an issue where users with a custom role were unable to save changes in the **Chat Settings** pane, even when their role had **View** and **Edit** permissions.\n* Fixed an issue that occurred after an agent configured their own hours of operation settings in the agent adapter. Those settings didn't appear for administrators in the agent's user profile on the **Settings > Users & Team > Manage Users & Teams** page. This prevented the administrator from making other edits to the agent's profile without overwriting the agent's hours of operation settings.\n* Fixed an issue where CRM tickets weren't created for some calls.\n* Fixed an issue where outbound SIP calls incorrectly appended data parameters, causing calls to fail.\n* Fixed a Web SDK security vulnerability associated with DOMPurify.\n* Fixed an issue where chat metadata wasn't saved to external storage.

Agent desktop is a customizable interface that provides agents quick access to the information and tools they need to handle customer sessions. The desktop layout includes the agent adapter as well as configurable panels that display information or tools. You can configure a distinct desktop layout for each session type: inbound calls, outbound calls, or chats. You can then configure which desktop layout that an agent sees when they answer an inbound call, place an outbound call, or handle a chat. You can also configure announcements to communicate updates, alerts, and other important information directly to agents. For more information, see [Agent desktop](https://cloud.google.com/contact-center/ccai-platform/docs/agent-desktop-overview).\n\nThe agent desktop provides the following capabilities:\n\n* **Create desktop layouts**. With agent desktop, you can create customized desktop layouts for different use cases for your human agents. These include receiving inbound calls, placing outbound calls, and handling chat sessions. Your layouts can contain call adapters, chat adapters, and a wide variety of panels for other capabilities such as live transcripts, knowledge assist, disposition codes, and session data feeds. You can also configure custom panels to use as widgets that you can drag into panels. For more information, see [Create desktop layouts](https://cloud.google.com/contact-center/ccai-platform/docs/agent-desktop-create-desktop-layouts).\n* **Configure custom panels**. A custom panel displays one or more URLs for external resources. These can be documentation, tools, or other resources. A custom panel appears as a widget in the desktop layout builder. Then, when you create desktop layouts, you can drag widgets into panels. For more information, see [Configure custom panels](https://cloud.google.com/contact-center/ccai-platform/docs/agent-desktop-configure-widgets).\n* **Use widgets**. Widgets are containers of specific functionality that you can drag into panels in the desktop layout builder. The desktop layout builder comes with a number of pre-defined widgets, such as **Session Data Feed**, **Disposition Codes and Notes**, **Knowledge Assist**, and **Live Transcript**.\n* **Configure desktop layouts for agents**. You can configure which desktop layout that agents see when they answer an inbound call, place an outbound call, or handle a chat. You can configure this globally, at the queue level, and at the team level. Queue-level layout settings take priority over global settings. Team-level settings take priority over both queue-level settings and default settings. For more information, see [Configure desktop layouts for agents](https://cloud.google.com/contact-center/ccai-platform/docs/agent-desktop-set-desktop-layouts).\n* **Configure announcements**. With announcements, you can communicate updates, alerts, and other important information directly to agents. Announcements appear in the agent desktop as notification banners that persist until the agent dismisses them. Announcements also appear in the agent's announcement list. For more information, see [Configure announcements](https://cloud.google.com/contact-center/ccai-platform/docs/agent-desktop-configure-announcements).",

        "content": "**Salesforce ICU Update**\n\nThis is for Google Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) customers that use Salesforce integration with CCaaS.\n\nOn **June 15th, 2025**, Salesforce is rolling out an automatic upgrade to its International Components for Unicode (ICU) locale data. This affects how date, time, number, and currency formatting are handled across Apex, Visualforce, and Lightning components.\n\nThis change affects Salesforce integrations that are using Apex API versions earlier than 45.0. These integrations use the legacy Java locale behavior, which could cause formatting discrepancies, incorrect parsing, or runtime errors.\n\n**Solution**\n\nGoogle has reviewed the CCaaS managed package and has updated the impacted classes to use safe, ICU-compatible parsing and formatting methods. This includes cleaning up legacy code that uses older API versions, which might affect this transition.\n\nThe following table shows the affected classes:\n\n**Affected classes**\n\n| Name | API version |\n| --- | --- |\n| `UJETUtilsController` | 35.0 |\n| `UJETUtilsControllerTests` | 35.0 |\n| `UJETJWT` | 43.0 |\n| `UJETJWTTests` | 43.0 |\n| `UJETPageController` | 43.0 |\n\n**Required action**\n\nTo ensure compatibility with the Salesforce ICU update and prevent any operational impact, you must complete the following action before **June 15th, 2025**:\n\n* Install the [v1.40 update](https://login.salesforce.com/?ec=302&startURL=%2Fpackaging%2FinstallPackage.apexp%3Fp0%3D04tKk0000011MNw%26InstHostname%3Dlogin.salesforce.com).\n\nThis installation updates the affected classes. No further action is required.\n\n**What happens if you don't upgrade?**\n\nIf any part of your integration or Apex code uses versions earlier than 45.0 after June 15th, Salesforce will not apply the ICU formatting to those sections. This could potentially lead to issues, including the following:\n\n* Incorrect date and time parsing\n* Unexpected errors in workflows or automations\n* Mismatch between Lightning and Classic behavior\n* Breakage in integrations expecting consistent locale handling\n\nGoogle considers the affected classes in CC\\_AGENT\\_APP v1.38 to be safe. While some of the affected classes have legacy methods that are affected by this update, they are not being actively used and will be deprecated in version 1.40. Regardless, Google still recommends installing the v1.40 update. Not upgrading can potentially impact other solutions that are installed on the environment, as described in this communication.\n\n**Defer the update**\n\nAs described in [Enable the ICU Locale Formats](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.icu_migration_enable.htm&type=5), you can defer the automatic rollout of this update.\n\nTo defer this update, follow these steps:\n\n1. From the Quick Find search box in **Setup**, enter **User Interface**.\n2. On the User Interface page, deselect the **Enable ICU locale formats as part of the scheduled rollout** checkbox.\n\n**Important**: This will only be effective if completed before **June 15th 2025**.",
