# Google Cloud Marketplace Partners

## 2025-11-06

### Changed

You can now offer Terraform Kubernetes apps through Google Cloud Marketplace with
usage-based pricing, in which customers pay for your app based on measurements
that you choose, called *metrics*, such as the number of containers or storage
time. For more information, see
[Pricing models for Terraform Kubernetes apps](https://docs.cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/partners/terraform-kubernetes#pricing).

### Changed

We've updated the Cloud Commerce Procurement API's `GET Account` resource to
provide the reseller parent Cloud Billing account ID for transactions
associated with resold Cloud Billing accounts. For transactions on
direct Cloud Billing accounts, no value is returned for the reseller
parent Cloud Billing account id. For details, see the
[Cloud Commerce Procurement API documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/partners/commerce-procurement-api/reference/rest/v1/providers.accounts/get).

### Feature

The [Detailed Disbursements](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/partners/reports/report-detailed-disbursement) and [Customer Incremental Insights](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/partners/reports/report-customer-insight#turn-on-customer-incremental-insights) ISV reports are now available in BigQuery. These reports leverage BigQuery's [out-of-the-box connectors](https://cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/connectors/bigquery/configure) to aggregate your Google Cloud Marketplace data with other data sources for your analysis, reporting, and data visualization needs.

[Learn how to enable these new reports from the Producer Portal](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/partners/reports/set-up-reports).
