# Google Cloud Marketplace Partners

## 2025-10-06

### Changed

We've updated the Cloud Commerce Procurement API's `GET Account` resource to
provide the reseller parent Cloud Billing account ID for transactions
associated with resold Cloud Billing accounts. For transactions on
direct Cloud Billing accounts, no value is returned for the reseller
parent Cloud Billing account id. For details, see the
[Cloud Commerce Procurement API documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/partners/commerce-procurement-api/reference/rest/v1/providers.accounts/get).

### Feature

The [Detailed Disbursements](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/partners/reports/report-detailed-disbursement) and [Customer Incremental Insights](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/partners/reports/report-customer-insight#turn-on-customer-incremental-insights) ISV reports are now available in BigQuery. These reports leverage BigQuery's [out-of-the-box connectors](https://cloud.google.com/integration-connectors/docs/connectors/bigquery/configure) to aggregate your Google Cloud Marketplace data with other data sources for your analysis, reporting, and data visualization needs.

[Learn how to enable these new reports from the Producer Portal](https://cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/partners/reports/set-up-reports).
