### Changed

We've updated the Cloud Commerce Procurement API's `GET Account` resource to
provide the reseller parent Cloud Billing account ID for transactions
associated with resold Cloud Billing accounts. For transactions on
direct Cloud Billing accounts, no value is returned for the reseller
parent Cloud Billing account id. For details, see the
[Cloud Commerce Procurement API documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/marketplace/docs/partners/commerce-procurement-api/reference/rest/v1/providers.accounts/get).
