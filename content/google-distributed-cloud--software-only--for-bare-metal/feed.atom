    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following features were added in 1.34.0-gke.566:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Preview</strong>: Vertical Pod autoscaling can now be configured to use your
  Prometheus instance as a persistent history provider for long-term CPU and
  memory usage data.</li>
<li><strong>Preview</strong>: Added support for horizontal Pod autoscaling that uses custom
  metrics from your Prometheus server to scale your applications, eliminating
  the operational burden of manually deploying and managing the adapter, its
  configuration, and RBAC. The automated solution handles the entire
  lifecycle, making it simpler to scale applications based on the metrics that
  matter most to your business.</li>
<li><strong>Preview</strong>: Added support for fast failover for the egress NAT gateway
  running in high availability. This feature improves both the reliability and
  throughput of egress traffic.</li>
<li><strong>GA</strong>: Added support for skip minor version cluster upgrades. You can
  directly upgrade your cluster control plane nodes (and entire cluster if
  worker node pools aren't pinned at a lower version) to two minor versions
  above the current version. Added the <a href="https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/bare-metal/docs/reference/bmctl#upgrade_intermediate-version"><code>bmctl upgrade
  intermediate-version</code></a>
  command to print the intermediate version for a skip minor version upgrade.</li>
<li><strong>Preview</strong>: Added support for advanced networking features on admin
  clusters. This capability lets you specify <a href="https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/bare-metal/docs/how-to/multi-nic">multiple network interfaces for
  Pods</a>
  and lets you use <a href="https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/bare-metal/%0A%20docs/how-to/lb-bundled-bgp">bundled load balancing with BGP</a> on your version 1.34 or higher admin clusters.</li>

<ul>
<li>Enabled Ansible SSH pipelining by default to improve performance. This can
  be disabled by adding the annotation
  <code>preview.baremetal.cluster.gke.io/ansible-ssh-pipelining: "disable"</code> to the
  Cluster custom resource.</li>
<li>During cluster creation and update operations, NodePools validate IP address
  uniqueness against all existing underlay Nodes, regardless of status. Node
  deprovisioning is blocked until the associated Kubernetes Node is deleted,
  unless the <code>node-deletion-timeout-seconds</code> annotation is present on the
  cluster.</li>
<li>Upgraded containerd from 1.7 to 2.0.</li>
<li>Registry mirror configuration information has been migrated to the
  <code>hosts.toml</code> containerd config file.</li>
<li>Upgrade preflight checks now validate PodDisruptionBudgets.</li>
<li>GKE Identity Service has been migrated from a Deployment to a DaemonSet for
  improved reliability on control plane nodes.</li>
<li>Added support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.6.</li>
<li>Removed support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 as it is beyond the <a href="https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata#RHEL8_and_9_Life_Cycle">Red
  Hat support
  window</a>.</li>
<li>Added support for the 6.14 kernel package is supported for use with Ubuntu
  24.04 LTS.</li>

    <summary>This release introduces performance enhancements through enabled Ansible SSH pipelining by default and an upgrade to containerd 2.0. It also boosts reliability with changes to NodePool IP validation and the migration of GKE Identity Service to a DaemonSet.

  Authentication</a>
  together with a <a href="https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/bare-metal/docs/installing/registry-mirror">registry
  mirror</a>
  caused containerd instability. To use the fix, add the
  <code>baremetal.cluster.gke.io/enable-gcr-image-credential-refresh: "false"</code>
  cluster annotation.</li>
<li>Fixed a timeout issue for the <code>kubeadm</code> API server health check that runs
  during bootstrap cluster creation. The timeout issue blocked some cluster
  operations, such as restoring a cluster.</li>
<li>This patch release doesn't include new <a href="https://docs.cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/bare-metal/docs/vulnerabilities">fixes for specific, externally-cited

</ul>]]></content>
    <summary>Containerd instability when using Workload Identity Cluster Authentication with a registry mirror has been fixed by adding a cluster annotation.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following features were added in 1.33.0-gke.799:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GA</strong>: Introduced an Envoy sidecar into the GKE Identity Service to
  increase security, reliability, and performance.</li>
<li><strong>GA</strong>: Added support for the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS operating system with Linux
  kernel versions, such as 6.8 and 6.11. Support for Linux kernel 6.14 is
  explicitly excluded.</li>
<li><strong>GA</strong>: Added the ability to override the cluster-level pod density setting
  for individual node pools.</li>
<li><strong>Preview</strong>: Added Node Agent to give you the ability to transition from
  using Ansible over SSH for cluster operations to a more secure, agent-based
  model. Added <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/bare-metal/docs/reference/bmctl#nodeagent"><code>bmctl
  nodeagent</code></a>
  commands to provide a straightforward and reliable process of migrating
  existing clusters to use Node Agent.</li>
<li><strong>Preview</strong>: Added a bundled version of the <a href="https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/index.html#about-the-nvidia-gpu-operator">NVIDIA GPU Operator</a>
  (version 25.3.1). The bundled operator is an open-source solution for
  managing the NVIDIA software components needed to provision and manage GPU
  devices.</li>
<li><strong>Preview</strong>: Added Dynamic Resource Allocation, a Kubernetes API that lets
  you request and share generic resources, such as GPUs, among pods and
  containers. When enabled, this capability helps you run AI workloads by
  dynamically and precisely allocating the GPU resources within your bare
  metal clusters, improving resource utilization and performance for demanding
  workloads.</li>
<li><strong>Preview</strong>: Added vertical Pod autoscaling, which lets you analyze and set
  CPU and memory resources required by Pods. Instead of having to set
  up-to-date CPU requests and limits and memory requests and limits for the
  containers in your Pods, you can configure vertical Pod autoscaling to
  provide recommended values for CPU and memory requests and limits that you
  can use to manually update your Pods, or you can configure vertical Pod
  autoscaling to automatically update the values.</li>
<li><strong>Preview</strong>: Added support for skip minor version cluster upgrades. You can
  directly upgrade your cluster control plane nodes (and entire cluster if
  worker node pools aren't pinned at a lower version) to two minor versions
  above the current version. Added the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/bare-metal/docs/reference/bmctl#upgrade_intermediate-version"><code>bmctl upgrade
  intermediate-version</code></a>
  to print the intermediate version for a skip minor version upgrade.</li>
<li>Surface failures from node pool status to the <code>RecentFailures</code> field in
  cluster status.</li>
<li>Surface failures from failed preflight checks triggered by the cluster
  controller to the <code>RecentFailures</code> field in cluster status.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
    <summary>The latest release introduces an Envoy sidecar for enhanced security and performance, adds support for Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, and allows overriding pod density settings. Preview features include a Node Agent for secure cluster operations, NVIDIA GPU Operator integration, Dynamic Resource Allocation for GPUs, vertical Pod autoscaling, and support for skipping minor version upgrades.</summary>

<li>Changed logging behavior so that kubeadm logs show up in the journald of the

<li>To help prevent stale ARP cache issues, <code>iptables-persistent</code> is installed

<li>Cluster manifests are deployed using a Kubernetes job, allowing the cluster
  operator to be more responsive to cluster events.</li>

  version skew

  doesn't comply with the version skew rules, the upgrade is halted.</li>
<li>Updated health checks and upgrade preflight checks to inspect for kubeadm
  certificate expiration.</li>
<li>Updated etcd version to 3.5.21.</li>

  Hat support

  improved security.</li>
