Support for Linux kernel 6.14 is\n  explicitly excluded.\n* **GA**: Added the ability to override the cluster-level pod density setting\n  for individual node pools.\n* **Preview**: Added Node Agent to give you the ability to transition from\n  using Ansible over SSH for cluster operations to a more secure, agent-based\n  model. Added [`bmctl\n  nodeagent`](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/bare-metal/docs/reference/bmctl#nodeagent)\n  commands to provide a straightforward and reliable process of migrating\n  existing clusters to use Node Agent.\n* **Preview**: Added a bundled version of the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/index.html#about-the-nvidia-gpu-operator)\n  (version 25.3.1). The bundled operator is an open-source solution for\n  managing the NVIDIA software components needed to provision and manage GPU\n  devices.\n* **Preview**: Added Dynamic Resource Allocation, a Kubernetes API that lets\n  you request and share generic resources, such as GPUs, among pods and\n  containers. When enabled, this capability helps you run AI workloads by\n  dynamically and precisely allocating the GPU resources within your bare\n  metal clusters, improving resource utilization and performance for demanding\n  workloads.\n* **Preview**: Added vertical Pod autoscaling, which lets you analyze and set\n  CPU and memory resources required by Pods. Instead of having to set\n  up-to-date CPU requests and limits and memory requests and limits for the\n  containers in your Pods, you can configure vertical Pod autoscaling to\n  provide recommended values for CPU and memory requests and limits that you\n  can use to manually update your Pods, or you can configure vertical Pod\n  autoscaling to automatically update the values.\n* **Preview**: Added support for skip minor version cluster upgrades. You can\n  directly upgrade your cluster control plane nodes (and entire cluster if\n  worker node pools aren't pinned at a lower version) to two minor versions\n  above the current version. Added the [`bmctl upgrade\n  intermediate-version`](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/bare-metal/docs/reference/bmctl#upgrade_intermediate-version)\n  to print the intermediate version for a skip minor version upgrade.\n* Surface failures from node pool status to the `RecentFailures` field in\n  cluster status.\n* Surface failures from failed preflight checks triggered by the cluster\n  controller to the `RecentFailures` field in cluster status.",
