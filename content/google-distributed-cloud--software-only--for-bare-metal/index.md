Google Distributed Cloud for bare metal 1.33.0-gke.799 runs on Kubernetes
v1.33.2-gke.700.

After a release, it takes approximately 7 to 14 days for the version to become
available for installations or upgrades with the [GKE On-Prem API
clients](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/bare-metal/docs/installing/cluster-lifecycle-management-tools):

partners](https://cloud.google.com/anthos/docs/resources/partner-storage) document to make sure the
storage vendor has already passed the qualification for this release of Google
Distributed Cloud for bare metal.

### Feature

The following features were added in 1.33.0-gke.799:

* **GA**: Introduced an Envoy sidecar into the GKE Identity Service to
  increase security, reliability, and performance.
* **GA**: Added support for the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS operating system with Linux
  kernel versions, such as 6.8 and 6.11. Support for Linux kernel 6.14 is
  explicitly excluded.
* **GA**: Added the ability to override the cluster-level pod density setting
  for individual node pools.
* **Preview**: Added Node Agent to give you the ability to transition from
  using Ansible over SSH for cluster operations to a more secure, agent-based
  model. Added [`bmctl
  nodeagent`](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/bare-metal/docs/reference/bmctl#nodeagent)
  commands to provide a straightforward and reliable process of migrating
  existing clusters to use Node Agent.
* **Preview**: Added a bundled version of the [NVIDIA GPU Operator](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/gpu-operator/latest/index.html#about-the-nvidia-gpu-operator)
  (version 25.3.1). The bundled operator is an open-source solution for
  managing the NVIDIA software components needed to provision and manage GPU
  devices.
* **Preview**: Added Dynamic Resource Allocation, a Kubernetes API that lets
  you request and share generic resources, such as GPUs, among pods and
  containers. When enabled, this capability helps you run AI workloads by
  dynamically and precisely allocating the GPU resources within your bare
  metal clusters, improving resource utilization and performance for demanding
  workloads.
* **Preview**: Added vertical Pod autoscaling, which lets you analyze and set
  CPU and memory resources required by Pods. Instead of having to set
  up-to-date CPU requests and limits and memory requests and limits for the
  containers in your Pods, you can configure vertical Pod autoscaling to
  provide recommended values for CPU and memory requests and limits that you
  can use to manually update your Pods, or you can configure vertical Pod
  autoscaling to automatically update the values.
* **Preview**: Added support for skip minor version cluster upgrades. You can
  directly upgrade your cluster control plane nodes (and entire cluster if
  worker node pools aren't pinned at a lower version) to two minor versions
  above the current version. Added the [`bmctl upgrade
  intermediate-version`](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/bare-metal/docs/reference/bmctl#upgrade_intermediate-version)
  to print the intermediate version for a skip minor version upgrade.
* Surface failures from node pool status to the `RecentFailures` field in
  cluster status.
* Surface failures from failed preflight checks triggered by the cluster
  controller to the `RecentFailures` field in cluster status.

### Changed

The following functional changes were made in 1.33.0-gke.799:

* Changed logging behavior so that kubeadm logs show up in the journald of the
  node machine where kubeadm runs.
* To help prevent stale ARP cache issues, `iptables-persistent` is installed
  in Debian nodes.
* Cluster manifests are deployed using a Kubernetes job, allowing the cluster
  operator to be more responsive to cluster events.
* Updated the validation checks for cluster upgrades to enforce the [cluster
  version skew
  rules](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/bare-metal/docs/how-to/upgrade-lifecycle#version_skew)
  for user clusters. If the upgrade version information for a user cluster
  doesn't comply with the version skew rules, the upgrade is halted.
* Updated health checks and upgrade preflight checks to inspect for kubeadm
  certificate expiration.
* Updated etcd version to 3.5.21.
* Removed support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 as it is beyond the [Red
  Hat support
  window](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata#RHEL8_and_9_Life_Cycle).
* Removed support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as it has reached the end of [standard
  security maintenance in May
  2025](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle#ubuntu-kernel-release-cycle).
* Upgraded `ansible-core` to 2.16.4 to support Python 3.12.
* Increased the RSA key size for Cluster API certifications to 4096 bits for
  improved security.

### Fixed

The following issues were fixed in 1.33.0-gke.799:

* Fixed an issue where restoring a cluster that has a node with a GPU causes
  instability of pods on the nodes.
* Fixed an issue that caused the Ansible playbook for handling Cloud Audit
  Logging to fail and not complete.
* Fixed an issue that caused nodes to get stuck in maintenance mode. Health
  checks have been updated so that the network check job skips connectivity
  checks for nodes that are in maintenance mode.
* Fixed an issue where the CronJob for periodic health checks wasn't updating
  after configuration changes.
* Fixed vulnerabilities listed in [Vulnerability
  fixes](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/bare-metal/docs/vulnerabilities).
