<li>GA: Enabled the <code>vsphere-metrics-exporter</code> component for advanced clusters. This exporter provides greater visibility into the VMware vSphere environment by collecting key performance and health metrics.</li>
<li>GA: Added support for VM-Host affinity groups in advanced clusters. This feature allows for the creation of rules that constrain cluster nodes to run on specific, predefined groups of hosts.</li>
<li>GA: Added support for automatic node resizing in advanced clusters. This feature optimizes resource use by automatically adjusting the CPU and memory allocated to control plane nodes in response to workload demands.</li>
<li>Public Preview: Added support for Virtual Machine (VM) tracking using vSphere
  tags in advanced clusters. This feature simplifies resource management by
  automatically applying identifying tags to cluster VMs.</li>
<li>GA: Introduced an Envoy proxy sidecar to the GKE Identity Service for clusters
  that use Controlplane V2. This change enhances the security, reliability, and
  performance of the authentication service.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
    <summary>Advanced clusters now support VM-Host affinity, automatic node resizing, and the vsphere-metrics-exporter for better VMware visibility. VM tracking with vSphere tags is in public preview. Envoy proxy enhances GKE Identity Service security.</summary>
