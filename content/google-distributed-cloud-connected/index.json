For more information, see [Back up a virtual machine](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/vm-servers#back_up_a_virtual_machine).\n* **Configurable runtime class for container workloads.** As part of gVisor integration in Google Distributed Cloud connected, you can now specify the default runtime class for container workloads at both Pod and cluster level. Cluster-level runtime class selection is a preview-level feature. For more information, see [Configure the runtime class for a Pod](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/deploy#runtime-class).\n* **Island mode networking.** Google Distributed Cloud connected now supports [island mode networking](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/distributed-cloud/bare-metal/docs/reference/flat-vs-island-network) on secondary network interfaces. For more information, see [(Optional) Configure island mode](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/networking#island-mode).\n* **`AppArmor` sandboxing audit logs for VM workloads.** Google Distributed Cloud connected now lets you enable audit logs for virtual machine workloads sandboxed using `AppArmor` policies. To enable audit log emission on an existing virtual machine workload, restart the corresponding virtual machine. For more information, see [View AppArmor sandboxing audit logs](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/vm-servers#view_apparmor_sandboxing_audit_logs).\n* **CoreDNS resolution for secondary networks.** Google Distributed Cloud connected now supports specifying a CIDR block for use with secondary networks at both Pod and cluster level. This allows for CoreDNS resolution on secondary network interfaces. For more information, see [`Network` resource](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/network-function#Network).\n* **Access clusters through Connect Gateway.** You can now access your Google Distributed Cloud connected clusters through Connect Gateway. For more information, see [Obtain cluster credentials through Connect Gateway](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/clusters#gateway).\n* **VNC support for accessing VM workloads through Connect Gateway.** You can now use VNC to access your virtual machine workloads through Connect Gateway.",

Symcloud Storage persistent volumes in filesystem mode are not affected.\n* **Cilium does not differentiate between TCP and UDP protocols.** Cilium does not differentiate between TCP and UDP protocols for services that use both protocols on the same port number and routes traffic for both protocols to the same backend pods. This can render such services non-functional. To work around this issue, use a different port for each protocol.\n* **Overlapping the Pod and cluster CIDR blocks for secondary networks causes network failure.** If you specify overlapping CIDR blocks for Pods and clusters using the `annotations.networking.gke.io/gdce-pod-cidr` and `annotations.networking.gke.io/gke-gateway-clusterip-cidr` annotations in the `Network` resource, the Google Distributed Cloud connected virtual networking subsystem might behave erratically, including loss of connectivity. Follow the guidelines in [(Optional) Configure island mode](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/networking#island-mode) to prevent this issue.\n* **The `anthos-multinet` container might take up to two hours to fully start.** You might intermittently experience a slower than normal startup for the `anthos-multinet` container (up to two hours).
