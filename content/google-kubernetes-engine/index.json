We expect to complete these improvements across GKE\nby October, 2025.\n\nThis maintenance is happening gradually across all GKE clusters,\nand will occur in your clusters only during configured maintenance windows. The\nmaintenance process is expected to take approximately 15 minutes to complete\nduring your cluster's maintenance window.\n\n**Expected impact**\n\nDuring the internal control plane datastore maintenance, the\n**Kubernetes API server will be unavailable for 15 minutes**, regardless of\nwhether you use a regional cluster or a zonal cluster. During this 15-minute\nperiod, you won't be able to interact with the Kubernetes API server for your\ncluster.\n\nConsider the following potential disruptions to your normal workflows during the\nmaintenance window for your cluster:\n\n* **Kubernetes API unavailability**: you can't use the `kubectl` tool or any\n  other Kubernetes API client to issue commands to the control plane,\n  regardless of whether the cluster is regional or zonal. Attempts to deploy,\n  modify, or query resources by using the Kubernetes API will fail during this\n  period.\n* **Halted deployments:** automated deployment pipelines (CI/CD) that interact\n  with the Kubernetes API will fail to complete tasks such as deploying or\n  updating applications in the cluster.\n* **Google Cloud console limitations**: operations for the cluster in the\n  Google Cloud console that communicate with the Kubernetes API might fail\n  during the maintenance period.\n* **Delayed control plane automation**: features that are managed by the\n  control plane, such as the cluster autoscaler, Horizontal or Vertical\n  Pod Autoscaling adjustments, or some node auto-repair operations might be\n  paused until the API server is online.\n\nThe following resources have no expected impact during the maintenance period:\n\n* **Running applications**: any running applications and services on your\n  nodes should continue to function without interruptions.\n* **Node pool operations**: existing nodes should remain connected and\n  operational.\n* **Network traffic**: traffic in the data plane, such as traffic to and from\n  your running workloads, shouldn't be affected.\n\n**What you need to do**\n\nNo action is required from you for the maintenance to occur. To plan for this\nmaintenance, we recommend that you do the following:\n\n* **Review maintenance windows**: review your cluster's\n  [maintenance window and exclusions settings](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/maintenance-windows-and-exclusions)\n  and schedule maintenance windows during periods that minimize disruptions to\n  your normal workflows.\n* **Plan for Kubernetes API unavailability**: if you run critical operations\n  in your cluster that require access to the Kubernetes API, avoid scheduling\n  these operations during maintenance windows.",
