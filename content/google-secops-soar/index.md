For more information on how playbook permissions work with users and API keys, see [Playbook permissions](http://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/soar/respond/working-with-playbooks/playbook-permissions).

For specific instructions on configuring GitSync with restricted playbooks, see [GitSync - Work with playbook permissions](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/soar/marketplace/power-ups/gitsync#work-with-playbook-permissions).

This enhancement allows users to leverage organization-specific data captured in custom fields to gain deeper insights and create tailored visualizations within Looker reports. Specific LookML formulas and filtering guidance are now available.

For more information on how to use custom fields in Advanced Reports, see [Use Custom Fields in Advanced Reports](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/soar/investigate/working-with-cases/adding-custom-fields#use-custom-fields-in-advanced-reports).
