### Announcement

Infrastructure Manager will deprecate support for Terraform version `1.2.3` on
**January 8, 2026**.

If you have [enabled auto-migration](https://docs.cloud.google.com/infrastructure-manager/docs/terraform-version-deprecation#auto-migration),
your deployments using Terraform version `1.2.3` will be migrated automatically to
Terraform version `1.5.7`.

We recommend that you upgrade your deployment Terraform version from `1.2.3`
to version `1.5.7` before the version `1.2.3.` end of support date on
**February 8, 2026**.
