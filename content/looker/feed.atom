    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The following updates have been made for <a href="https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/period-over-period">Period-over-period (PoP) measures</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PoP measure feature is out of Preview and is now generally available. <strong>Note:</strong> This item was added on August 21, 2025.</li>
<li>PoP measures are now supported for MySQL 8.0.12+ connections to Looker. <strong>Note:</strong> This item was added on August 18, 2025.</li>
<li>You can now specify the following types of measures in the PoP measure's <a href="https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/period-over-period#based_on"><code>based_on</code></a> parameter: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/param-measure-types#list"><code>list</code></a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/param-measure-types#median"><code>median</code></a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/param-measure-types#median_distinct"><code>median_distinct</code></a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/param-measure-types#number"><code>number</code></a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/param-measure-types#percentile"><code>percentile</code></a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/reference/param-measure-types#percentile_distinct"><code>percentile_distinct</code></a>. <strong>Note:</strong> This item was added on August 21, 2025.</li>
<li>For queries with PoP measures and time-based filters, in order to calculate data for the PoP measure Looker now automatically retrieves an extra time period of the coarsest time granularity in the query. (Previously, the user was required to adjust the granularity of time-based filters in order to account for the PoP measure calculations.) <strong>Note:</strong> This item was added on August 21, 2025.</li>
<li>For queries with PoP measures, if no time-based dimensions are included in the query from the Explore's field picker, Looker can now infer the time period from time-based dimensions in the Explore's filters. (Previously, for queries with PoP measures, the user was required to specify a time-based dimension from the Explore's field picker.) See <a href="https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/period-over-period#explore-requirements">Requirements for Explore queries with PoP measures</a> for more information. <strong>Note:</strong> This item was added on August 21, 2025.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/embed-sdk-intro">Embed SDK</a> has been upgraded to release 2.0.0. While the 2.0.0 API is backwards-compatible with Embed SDK 1.8.x, the underlying implementation has changed for some functionality. SDK 1.8.x exported a number of classes. SDK 2.0.0 replaces these classes with interfaces that are marked as deprecated (alternative interfaces are identified). We recommend that applications use the interfaces that have an 'I' prefix (the interfaces that have prefixes are identical to the interfaces that don't have them). Applications that are upgraded to SDK 2.0.0 should continue to work and behave as they did previously. To take advantage of the API improvements, some refactoring will be required. The following major changes are included in Embed SDK 2.0.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>Navigating between dashboards, Explores, and Looks no longer requires that an iframe be recreated. Instead, the <code>loadDashboard</code>, <code>loadLook</code>, <code>loadExplore</code>, and <code>loadUrl</code> methods can be used to navigate within the Looker iframe.</li>
<li><code>connect</code> now returns a unified connection rather than a connection that is related only to a dashboard, a Look, or an Explore. The unified connection allows embedding applications to detect a user navigating inside the iframe.</li>
<li>Support for additional Looker embedded content has been added for Looker reports and query visualizations.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This item was added on June 13, 2025.</p>]]></content>
    <summary>The Embed SDK has been upgraded to version 2.0.0. This new version is backward-compatible with 1.8.x but introduces changes to how classes are exported, recommending the use of interfaces instead. Key improvements include eliminating the need to recreate iframes for navigation, a unified connection object for better event detection, and expanded support for Looker reports and query visualizations. Some refactoring may be needed to leverage the new features.</summary>
