While the 2.0.0 API is backwards-compatible with Embed SDK 1.8.x, the underlying implementation has changed for some functionality. SDK 1.8.x exported a number of classes. SDK 2.0.0 replaces these classes with interfaces that are marked as deprecated (alternative interfaces are identified). We recommend that applications use the interfaces that have an 'I' prefix (the interfaces that have prefixes are identical to the interfaces that don't have them). Applications that are upgraded to SDK 2.0.0 should continue to work and behave as they did previously. To take advantage of the API improvements, some refactoring will be required. The following major changes are included in Embed SDK 2.0.0:\n\n* Navigating between dashboards, Explores, and Looks no longer requires that an iframe be recreated. Instead, the `loadDashboard`, `loadLook`, `loadExplore`, and `loadUrl` methods can be used to navigate within the Looker iframe.\n* `connect` now returns a unified connection rather than a connection that is related only to a dashboard, a Look, or an Explore. The unified connection allows embedding applications to detect a user navigating inside the iframe.\n* Support for additional Looker embedded content has been added for Looker reports and query visualizations.\n\n**Note:** This item was added on June 13, 2025.",
