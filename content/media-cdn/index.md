### Feature

You can use Autonomous System Numbers (ASN) based rules from Cloud Armor for Media CDN. ASN-based rules allow you to create security policies that specifically permit or deny traffic based on the ASN of the client requesting your content. This feature is **Generally Available**.

For more information, see [Google Cloud Armor support](https://cloud.google.com/media-cdn/docs/overview#armor-support).

### Feature

You can use Network Threat Intelligence (NTI) from Cloud Armor in Edge Security Policies for Media CDN edge cache services for Enterprise users. NTI helps identify and block requests originating from known malicious IP addresses and networks. This feature is **Generally Available**.

For an example, see [Example: Block traffic from known malicious IPs](https://cloud.google.com/media-cdn/docs/security-policies#example-block-malicious-using-NTI).
