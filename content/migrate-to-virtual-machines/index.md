### Feature

**Generally available:** The Basic Input/Output System (BIOS) to Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) conversion option is now generally available. Migrate to Virtual Machines lets you convert the OS boot type of a VM instance from BIOS to UEFI. This option is useful when you want to securely boot your VM instance, as secure boot is only supported by UEFI. For more information, see the table in [Configure the target for a migrated VM](https://cloud.google.com/migrate/virtual-machines/docs/5.0/migrate/migrating-vms#configure-target).
