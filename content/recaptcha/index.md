### Feature

Transaction Defense Reasons [is generally available](https://cloud.google.com/products?#product-launch-stages). This feature enhances transparency by providing clear, human-readable explanations for why a particular transaction receives a high transaction risk score. The reasons help you better understand the risk assessments and take more informed actions to protect against fraud.

For more information, see [Risk reason](https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.assessments#riskreason).

### Feature

We've enhanced the reCAPTCHA Admin console to provide a more intuitive interface for configuring risk score thresholds. These improvements help you define how to act on different risk scores. You can also get a better understanding of the transactions that will exceed the threshold which can help in deciding what you allow, block or further reviewing transactions.

For more information, see [Protect payment transactions with Fraud Prevention](https://cloud.google.com/recaptcha/docs/fraud-prevention).
