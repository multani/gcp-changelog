### Feature

**Vertex AI Search for commerce: Conversational Commerce agent, GA**

The Conversational Commerce agent uses LLM and conversational product filtering to provide users with a real-time, ongoing conversational experience. The conversational product filtering feature functions as part of the Guided Search package, helping narrow down search queries sooner by presenting users with either relevant products, follow-up questions, or both.

The Conversational Commerce agent is generally available (GA). For information, see [Conversational Commerce agent](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/conversational-search) and [Conversational product filtering](https://cloud.google.com/retail/docs/conversational-filtering).
