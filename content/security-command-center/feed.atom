    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Security Command Center has improved the automatic selection of resources when running
attack path simulations using the default high-value resource set.</p>
<p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/attack-exposure-supported-features">Risk Engine</a> uses
heuristics to identify resources used for non-production purposes. To help
ensure that you have information about the most important assets, Risk Engine
calculates the attack exposure score for all other resources in the default
high-value resource set before calculating the attack exposure score for these
non-production resources.</p>
