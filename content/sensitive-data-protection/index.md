# Sensitive Data Protection

## 2025-10-02

### Breaking

This is an addition to the May 1 release note announcing the deprecation of the
ability to send inspection and discovery results from Sensitive Data Protection
to Data Catalog.

If you have workflows that create inspection jobs or job triggers and set the
deprecated
[`PublishFindingsToCloudDataCatalog`](https://cloud.google.com/sensitive-data-protection/docs/reference/rest/v2/Action#publishfindingstoclouddatacatalog)
action, you must update those workflows by January 30, 2026. On or after this
date, new jobs and job triggers that are created by those workflows will fail.
