    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Speech-to-Text is excited to announce the General Availability (GA) of the Chirp 3: Transcription, the latest generation of Google's multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)-specific generative model, delivering state-of-the-art ASR accuracy and multilingual capabilities. Available exclusively in the Speech-to-Text API V2, Chirp 3 delivers significant enhancements in transcription accuracy and speed over previous versions.
Under the new <code>chirp_3</code> model identifier, you can now leverage powerful new capabilities, including speaker diarization to identify different speakers and automatic language detection for multilingual audio. The model supports all major recognition methods â€”<code>StreamingRecognize</code>, <code>Recognize</code>, and <code>BatchRecognize</code>- making it suitable for both real-time and batch processing. Chirp 3 also offers advanced features such as speech adaptation for custom vocabularies and a built-in denoiser to improve results from noisy audio.</p>
