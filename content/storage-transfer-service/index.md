# Storage Transfer Service

## 2025-12-02

### Feature

You can now transfer data from AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage to Cloud Storage
over a private network connection, using Cross-Cloud Interconnect or
Partner Interconnect. Transferring data over a private connection can
optimize costs, provide dedicated bandwidth, and help meet compliance needs by
keeping data off the public internet.

See [Transfer from AWS or Azure over a customer-managed private
network](https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage-transfer/docs/create-transfers/agentless/customer-managed-private-network)
for details.
