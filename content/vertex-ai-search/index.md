### Changed

**Vertex AI Search: Renamed from AI Applications**

The AI Applications product has been renamed as Vertex AI Search in the following contexts:

* The documentation set. See [What is Vertex AI Search?](https://docs.cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/introduction)
* The marketing collateral. See [Vertex AI Search](https://docs.cloud.google.com/enterprise-search).

What has not changed:

* The user interface in the Google Cloud console is still referred to as AI Applications. See [AI Applications](https://console.cloud.google.com/gen-app-builder).
* The APIs still use the DiscoveryEngine API endpoints. See [APIs and reference](https://docs.cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/apis).

Despite the rebrand, the product functionality remains the same.
