Defining custom metrics for your load balancer gives you the flexibility to route application requests to the backend instances and endpoints that are most optimal for your workload.\n\nFor more information, see [Custom metrics for Application Load Balancers](https://cloud.google.com/load-balancing/docs/https/applb-custom-metrics).\n\nThis capability is in **General availability**."
