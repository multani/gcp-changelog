For example, when you search for `\"Mary had a little lamb\"`, Vertex AI Search looks for the phrase exactly as it is. It doesn't return search results that contain `Mary had lamb`, which has missing words; or `a little lamb had Mary`, which has the words in a different order.\n\nThis feature is Generally available when you use the [`engines.servingConfigs.search`](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.collections.engines.servingConfigs/search) method to get search results for [custom data](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/preview-search-results), [media data](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/get-media-search-results), and [healthcare data](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/search-hc-data)."

By excluding less relevant content such as boilerplate, you can improve data quality.
