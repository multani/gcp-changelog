### Feature

**Generally available**: You can apply a workload policy in a managed instance group (MIG) to specify the type of the workload to run on the MIG. Workload policies help improve the workload performance by optimizing the underlying infrastructure. The supported type, `high-throughput`, is ideal for workloads that require high networking performance. For more information, see [Workload policy for MIGs](https://cloud.google.com/ai-hypercomputer/docs/placement-policy-and-workload-policy#workload-policy).
