### Feature

GKE now reports CPU and memory requests and limits [metrics](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/api/metrics_kubernetes#kubernetes-kubernetes) for Kubernetes-native [sidecar containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/) starting from GKE version 1.32.4-gke.1106006.

### Feature

Flex-start provisioning mode on GKE now supports TPUs in single-host node pools. Flex-start makes accessing highly-demanded accelerators, like TPU v5e, v5p, and Trillium easier while optimizing their utilization. To learn more, see [About GPU and TPU provisioning with flex-start provisioning mode](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/dws).

### Changed

The insecure kubelet read-only port (`10255`) is disabled by default in all new clusters that run GKE version 1.32 and later. If you created your cluster using a GKE version earlier than 1.32, we recommend that you disable the insecure kubelet read-only port. For more information see [Disable the kubelet read-only port in GKE clusters](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/disable-kubelet-readonly-port).

### Feature

GKE now provides insights and recommendations that help you to [identify and remediate](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/troubleshooting/scalability#identify-fix-etcd-usage) clusters where the etcd cluster state database size is approaching the limit. Implementing the recommendation helps you to keep your clusters stable and performant.

### Feature

In GKE version 1.32.2-gke.1297000 and later, you can run GPU workloads on Confidential GKE Nodes with the [A3 High machine type](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/accelerator-optimized-machines#a3-standard-vms) and NVIDIA H100 GPUs. This enables stronger data protection and integrity for GPU-accelerated computations running within GKE clusters and nodes. This feature is available in [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). For more information, see [Encrypt GPU workload data in use with Confidential GKE Nodes](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/gpus-confidential-nodes).

### Feature

In GKE version 1.32.2-gke.1297000 and later, you can use the Intel TDX and AMD SEV-SNP [Confidential Computing technologies](https://cloud.google.com/confidential-computing/confidential-vm/docs/confidential-vm-overview) with Confidential GKE Nodes. This feature is in [General Availability](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). Use Confidential GKE Nodes to encrypt your workload data in-use through Compute Engine Confidential VMs for data and code confidentiality and integrity. For more information, see [Encrypt workload data in-use with Confidential GKE Nodes](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/confidential-gke-nodes).
