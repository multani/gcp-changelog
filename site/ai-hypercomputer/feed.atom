    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Generally available</strong>: When you reserve capacity for creating VMs, you can specify the reservation operational mode for your reserved capacity. A reservation operational mode defines how your VMs behave after a host error or faulty host report, and it determines your level of visibility and control over the reservation's infrastructure.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Generally available</strong>: You can troubleshoot workloads with slow performance by using straggler detection metrics and logs.</p>
<p><em>Stragglers</em> are single-point, non-crashing failures that eventually
slow down your entire workload. Large-scale ML workloads are very susceptible to stragglers, and VMs with stragglers are often very difficult to notice and pinpoint without straggler detection.</p>

The collected performance metrics and operational events are used for analyzing and optimizing large-scale AI and ML training workloads.</p>
<p>CoMMA is automatically installed and enabled on A4X, A4 High, and A3 Ultra machine types when using specific images. You can manage this data collection by disabling the plugin, adjusting its data granularity levels, or manually installing it on other GPU machine types.

By creating a request in calendar mode, you can reserve up to 80 GPU VMs for a future date and time. Then, you can use that capacity to run the following workloads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Model pre-training</li>
<li>Model fine-tuning</li>
<li>Simulations</li>
