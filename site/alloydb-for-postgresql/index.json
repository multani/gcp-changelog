You still need to make sure you have reliable and low latency network connectivity between the primary and secondary data centers, which is crucial for cross-data-center replication to function effectively. For more information, see \"Work with cross-data-center replication\" for AlloyDB Omni [15.12.0](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/omni/15.12.0/docs/cross-data-center-replication/work-with-cross-data-center-replication) and [16.8.0](https://cloud.google.com/alloydb/omni/16.8.0/docs/cross-data-center-replication/work-with-cross-data-center-replication).\n* AlloyDB Omni Kubernetes images are now built on Red Hat's Universal Base Image (UBI) 9.
