To avoid potential feature limitations, we recommend enabling this add-on for API hub instances associated with Apigee organizations that don't have VPC-SC enabled.\n\nFor more information, see [Advanced API Security for multiple Apigee organizations and gateways](https://docs.cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/apihub/advanced-api-security-multi-gateway).\n\n**Note:** Rollouts of this feature will begin today, and may take five or more business days to be completed across all Google Cloud zones.
