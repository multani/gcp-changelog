The GKE Inference Gateway is an extension to the GKE Gateway that provides optimized routing and load balancing for serving generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) workloads. It simplifies the deployment, management, and observability of AI inference workloads.\n\nWith this new integration, GKE Inference Gateway users can now leverage Apigee's full suite of features to manage, govern and monetize their AI workload through APIs.\n\nTo learn more, see [Create an ApigeeBackendService](https://cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/api-platform/apigee-kubernetes/apigee-apim-operator-apigeebackendservice).",
