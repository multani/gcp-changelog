For new installations, see [The big picture](https://docs.cloud.google.com/apigee/docs/hybrid/v1.16/big-picture) and then apply the hotfix to the new installation with the following instructions.\n\n#### Apply this hotfix with the following steps:\n\n**Note:** This hotfix installs the `apigee-mart-server` container images. All other container images are unchanged from Hybrid v1.16.0.\n\n1. In your overrides file, update the `image.url` and `image.tag` properties of `ao` and `mart` to version `1.16.0-hotfix.1`:\n\n   ```\n   ao:\n     image:\n       url: \"gcr.io/apigee-release/hybrid/apigee-operators\"\n       tag: \"1.16.0-hotfix.1\"\n\n   mart:\n     image:\n       url: \"gcr.io/apigee-release/hybrid/apigee-mart-server\"\n       tag: \"1.16.0-hotfix.1\"\n   ```\n2. Install the hotfix release for Apigee operators, beginning with a dry run:\n\n   ```\n   helm upgrade operator apigee-operator/ \\\n     --install \\\n     --namespace APIGEE_NAMESPACE \\\n     --atomic \\\n     -f overrides.yaml \\\n     --dry-run=server\n   ```\n3. If the dry run is successful, install the hotfix release for Apigee operators:\n\n   ```\n   helm upgrade operator apigee-operator/ \\\n     --install \\\n     --namespace APIGEE_NAMESPACE \\\n     --atomic \\\n     -f overrides.yaml\n   ```\n4. Install the hotfix release for your organization, beginning with a dry run:\n\n   ```\n   helm upgrade $ORG_NAME apigee-org/ \\\n     --install \\\n     --namespace APIGEE_NAMESPACE \\\n     --atomic \\\n     -f overrides.yaml \\\n     --dry-run=server\n   ```\n5.

Verify the organization chart by checking the state:\n\n   ```\n   kubectl -n APIGEE_NAMESPACE get apigeeorg\n   ```\n7. Install the hotfix release for your environment, beginning with a dry run:\n\n   ```\n   helm upgrade ENV_RELEASE_NAME apigee-env/ \\\n     --install \\\n     --namespace APIGEE_NAMESPACE \\\n     --atomic \\\n     --set env=$ENV_NAME \\\n     -f overrides.yaml \\\n     --dry-run=server\n   ```\n8.
