The initial supported value is `AGENT`, which indicates that a workload is an AI agent.\n* **Extended metadata:** Services and workloads now include the `ExtendedMetadata` property to provide rich, structured, and schema-driven information about the resource, such as the `apphub.googleapis.com/AgentProperties` schema for AI agents.\n* **Registration type:** Services now have the `RegistrationType` property. This output-only field indicates whether a service is exclusive (can be registered to only one application) or shared (can be registered to multiple applications). To view the registration type of your services, see [View details of services and workloads](https://docs.cloud.google.com/app-hub/docs/modify-app-hub-resources#view).\n* **Identity:** Services and workloads now include the `Identity` property, which is an output-only field that contains the service account or managed workload identity name for a service or workload.",

This setup model is recommended for all new App Hub implementations and provides a centralized and scalable way to organize, deploy, and govern your applications.\n\nKey features of this release include:\n\n* **App-enabled folders**: You can now enable application management on a standard Google Cloud folder, which then becomes an app-enabled folder. This folder acts as the application management boundary for your App Hub applications.\n* **Management projects**: A dedicated management project is automatically created within your app-enabled folder to store application metadata and configurations, and to centralize operations.\n* **Simplified API management**: Required APIs for core App Hub features are automatically enabled on the management project. You can also enable recommended APIs to access the full application lifecycle experience.\n* **Flexible billing**: Linking a billing account is now optional. You can use App Hub's core features for organizing and observing your applications at no cost. A billing account is required only for other application-centric features.\n\nFor more information on how to get started, see [Set up App Hub with app-enabled folders](https://docs.cloud.google.com/app-hub/docs/set-up-app-hub-folder).",
