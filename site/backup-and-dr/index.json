You can also add or remove backup rules as needed.\n* Automatic Updates: Once a plan is edited, the changes are automatically applied to all resources protected by that plan for all future backups. There's no need to manually detach and reattach the plan.\n* Backward Compatibility: This new capability is available for all backup plans, including those created before this update.\n\nImportant Note: While most settings in a backup plan are now editable, the assigned backup vault cannot be changed.
