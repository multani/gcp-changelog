When you use capacity requests, you get best-effort assurance for the capacity that Google Cloud provisions, and you only pay for resources when you use them. This approach helps ensure that your Google Cloud project has sufficient capacity to prevent resource availability errors during unexpected growth, without committing to pay for resources that you might not use.\n\nFor more information, see [About capacity requests](https://cloud.google.com/capacity-planner/docs/about-capacity-requests).",
