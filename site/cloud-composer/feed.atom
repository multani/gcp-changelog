following recently released Cloud Composer versions:</p>

<p>To prevent additional environments from being affected, we have disabled the
ability to upgrade existing environments to these versions and to create new
environments using these versions. If your environment is already using one of
these versions, you can continue to use it as usual. We are working to resolve
the issue for all currently affected environments.</p>]]></content>
    <summary>We found an issue that may affect metrics reporting in specific recent Cloud Composer versions. To prevent further impact, we've blocked upgrades and new deployments of these versions. Affected environments can still be used, and we're working on a fix.</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If your environment uses <code>dag-factory</code> package version 0.22, then you might
experience DAG failures in Cloud Composer versions that have
<code>apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes</code> package version 10.4.2 or later. At
the same time, upgrading the <code>dag-factory</code> package to version 0.23 might require
you to update your DAG code to make it compatible.</p>
<p>If your environment uses <code>dag-factory</code> version 0.22, we recommend to do the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily postpone upgrading your environment until you're ready to switch
  to <code>dag-factory</code> version 0.23. Last versions of Cloud Composer that support
  version 0.22 are composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.3,
  composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.23, composer-2.13.1-airflow-2.10.5, and
  composer-2.13.1-airflow-2.9.3 released on May 14, 2025.</li>
<li>When you are ready to upgrade, update your DAGs for compatibility with 0.23.
  We recommend to do this in a development environment first.
  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-3/install-python-dependencies">Install</a>
  <code>dag-factory</code> version 0.23, then check that your DAGs are parsed and are
  working correctly, and update them if needed. After your DAGs are
  compatible, install <code>dag-factory</code> version 0.23 in your production
  environment and transfer the updated DAGs. Your environment can now be
  upgraded to a later version of Cloud Composer or Airflow.</li>
<li>If your environment is already upgraded to a later version of Cloud Composer
  and you experience problems, then update <code>dag-factory</code> to version 0.23 and
  update your DAGs for compatibility with 0.23.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
    <summary>This announcement provides guidance on potential DAG failures in Cloud Composer when using dag-factory version 0.22 with specific Airflow provider versions. It recommends postponing upgrades or updating to dag-factory version 0.23 with necessary DAG code modifications.</summary>

<li>We are introducing the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-versioning-overview#version-deprecation-and-support">standard support period</a> of 12 months after the release date.</li>
<li>All Airflow builds that didn't have an end of support date when this change was introduced are supported until July 1, 2026. Because of this change, some Airflow builds released before July 1, 2025 are supported for longer than the standard support period.</li>
<li>All Airflow builds that had their support date shorter than 12 months are now supported for 12 months since the date of their initial release.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We are gradually rolling out a change that <strong>switches the default version</strong> from Cloud Composer 2 to Cloud Composer 3 in the Cloud Composer API.</p>
<p>In regions where the change is rolled out, a Cloud Composer 3 environment is created by default when a version is not specified in Google Cloud CLI, Cloud Composer API, or Terraform. If you use automation scripts to provision Cloud Composer 2 environments, make sure that you explicitly specify a Cloud Composer 2 version.</p>
<p>In this release, the change is rolling out in the following regions: africa-south1, asia-northeast2, asia-south2, asia-southeast2, europe-southwest1, europe-west10, europe-west12, europe-west8, me-central1, me-central2, me-west1, southamerica-west1, and us-south1.</p>]]></content>
    <summary>The Cloud Composer API's default environment version is being updated from Cloud Composer 2 to Cloud Composer 3. This change will affect new environments created without a specified version in certain regions. Users relying on Cloud Composer 2 should explicitly select that version in their automation scripts.</summary>
