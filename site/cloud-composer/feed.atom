    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>If your environment uses <code>dag-factory</code> package version 0.22, then you might
experience DAG failures in Cloud Composer versions that have
<code>apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes</code> package version 10.4.2 or later. At
the same time, upgrading the <code>dag-factory</code> package to version 0.23 might require
you to update your DAG code to make it compatible.</p>
<p>If your environment uses <code>dag-factory</code> version 0.22, we recommend to do the
following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temporarily postpone upgrading your environment until you're ready to switch
  to <code>dag-factory</code> version 0.23. Last versions of Cloud Composer that support
  version 0.22 are composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.3,
  composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.23, composer-2.13.1-airflow-2.10.5, and
  composer-2.13.1-airflow-2.9.3 released on May 14, 2025.</li>
<li>When you are ready to upgrade, update your DAGs for compatibility with 0.23.
  We recommend to do this in a development environment first.
  <a href="https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-3/install-python-dependencies">Install</a>
  <code>dag-factory</code> version 0.23, then check that your DAGs are parsed and are
  working correctly, and update them if needed. After your DAGs are
  compatible, install <code>dag-factory</code> version 0.23 in your production
  environment and transfer the updated DAGs. Your environment can now be
  upgraded to a later version of Cloud Composer or Airflow.</li>
<li>If your environment is already upgraded to a later version of Cloud Composer
  and you experience problems, then update <code>dag-factory</code> to version 0.23 and
  update your DAGs for compatibility with 0.23.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
    <summary>This announcement provides guidance on potential DAG failures in Cloud Composer when using dag-factory version 0.22 with specific Airflow provider versions. It recommends postponing upgrades or updating to dag-factory version 0.23 with necessary DAG code modifications.</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We're changing the way we provide support dates for Airflow builds in Cloud Composer 3. Before this change, some Airflow builds had their end of support date listed as "To be announced" until a later Airflow version became available. We're deprecating this approach for all builds that are released after July 01, 2025.</p>
<p>We are now providing support dates that depend on a date when a particular Airflow build was released:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are introducing the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/composer/docs/composer-versioning-overview#version-deprecation-and-support">standard support period</a> of 12 months after the release date.</li>
<li>All Airflow builds that didn't have an end of support date when this change was introduced are supported until July 1, 2026. Because of this change, some Airflow builds released before July 1, 2025 are supported for longer than the standard support period.</li>
<li>All Airflow builds that had their support date shorter than 12 months are now supported for 12 months since the date of their initial release.</li>
<li>All builds released after July 1, 2025 will use the standard support period.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
    <summary>We are updating the support dates for Airflow builds in Cloud Composer 3. Starting July 1, 2025, all new builds will have a 12-month standard support period from their release date. Existing builds without a defined end of support date will now be supported until July 1, 2026, with some receiving extended support beyond the standard period.</summary>

If you use automation scripts to provision Cloud Composer 2 environments, make sure that you explicitly specify a Cloud Composer 2 version.</p>
<p>In this release, the change is rolling out in the following regions: africa-south1, asia-northeast2, asia-south2, asia-southeast2, europe-southwest1, europe-west10, europe-west12, europe-west8, me-central1, me-central2, me-west1, southamerica-west1, and us-south1.</p>]]></content>

<ul>
<li>After <strong>February 27, 2026</strong>, if your project has only Cloud Composer 3 environments, then you can manually disable the detached APIs.</li>
<li>After <strong>February 27, 2026</strong>, if your project has Cloud Composer 2 environments, then we recommend keeping these APIs enabled because disabling them might lead to environment's malfunction.</li>
<li>After <strong>May 27, 2026</strong>, if you use automation scripts to provision Cloud Composer 2 environments, then make sure that the listed APIs are enabled in addition to the Cloud Composer API.</li>
