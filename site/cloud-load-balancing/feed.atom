<p>Previously, when the GFEs didn't support HTTP/1.0 explicitly, the GFE would return an <code>SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_NOACK</code> response, disable ALPN, and fall back to using HTTP/1 (which includes HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1) as the default application protocol. After this change, GFEs will instead return <code>HTTP/1.0</code>, which provides clients with positive confirmation that their advertised <code>HTTP/1.0</code> was accepted.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Starting October 15, 2025, the global and classic external Application Load Balancers are improving HTTP header handling for headers with obs-fold values to comply with the <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html#section-5.2">RFC 9112</a> standard</strong></p>
<p>Previously, these load balancers would forward HTTP headers with obs-fold values (those split across multiple lines, with subsequent lines starting with a space or a tab) without any changes. Starting October 15, 2025, each obs-fold will be replaced with one or more space characters (SP octets) before forwarding the message upstream. This ensures that the header is correctly interpreted as a single line, as required by the HTTP specification.</p>
<p><strong>What you need to do</strong></p>
<p>Review your current client applications and backend services before October 15, 2025 and ensure that they generate HTTP headers with obs-fold values in a single-line format when communicating with these load balancers.</p>
<p>Because the obs-fold header fields have been deprecated in RFC 9112, compliant clients and servers should already avoid using this format. However, there is a possibility that services that specifically rely on the old, non-compliant multi-line format of headers with obs-fold values might experience unexpected behavior. You should proactively check your backend service logs for any errors originating from your services due to the modified obs-fold headers.</p>
<p>For more information on the HTTP specification regarding headers with obs-fold values, review <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9112.html#section-5.2">RFC 9112, Section 5.2: Obsolete Line Folding</a>.</p>]]></content>
    <summary>Starting October 15, 2025, Application Load Balancers will improve HTTP header handling for obs-fold values to comply with RFC 9112 standard. This change ensures correct interpretation of headers as a single line.</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In typical HTTPS communication, neither the load balancer nor the backend verify each other's identity, assuming that they are within a secure perimeter and can be trusted. However, when perimeter security needs reinforcement or communication extends beyond the perimeter, backend mTLS becomes essential. Backend mTLS ensures secure communication by requiring both the load balancer and the backend to mutually verify their identities.</p>
<p>With <em>backend authenticated TLS</em>, the load balancer verifies the backend server's certificate by checking its chain of trust, thereby confirming the backend's identity. Conversely, with <em>backend mTLS</em>, the backend server verifies the client certificate presented by the load balancer. Together, these mechanisms enable backend mTLS, ensuring that both parties validate each other's identity.</p>
<p>Backend mTLS complements frontend mTLS, which is already generally available (GA).</p>
