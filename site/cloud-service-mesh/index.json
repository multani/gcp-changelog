After considering the impact on customers, we have decided to restore the previous behavior from 1.20 and earlier for managed Cloud Service Mesh clusters using the `ISTIOD` implementation to match Rapid clusters using the `TRAFFIC_DIRECTOR` implementation. These changes are rolling out to the Rapid release channel in version 1.21.5-asm.55 or later.\n\n* If you are using an `ExternalName` service in the Rapid channel without a port description, the `ExternalName` service will not be translated into `Cluster` in the Envoy configuration. If the `ExternalName` service is a destination of `VirtualService` or `ExternalName` service is used with `REGISTRY_ONLY` mode, you must specify the port in the service like in 1.20 and earlier.\n* If you have an external service multiplexing traffic based on SNI but the corresponding `DestinationRule` doesn't have an explicit SNI, you must [set SNI properly](https://cloud.google.com/service-mesh/docs/troubleshooting/troubleshoot-security#explicit_sni_setup).",
