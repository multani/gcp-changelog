Although instances can't use both backup options at the same time, Cloud SQL gives you the ability to switch between these backup options as necessary.\n\nFor more information about the available options and their limitations, see [Backup options](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/sqlserver/backup-recovery/backups#backup-options).",
