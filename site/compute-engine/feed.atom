    <content type="text/markdown">**Generally available**: The general-purpose C4D machine series offers the following bare metal machine types:

* `c4d-standard-384-metal`
* `c4d-highcpu-384-metal`
* `c4d-highmem-384-metal`

This is the first machine series to offer AMD-based bare metal instances. Bare metal instances let you create an instance with direct access to the machine's CPU and memory, without a virtualization layer in the middle. C4D uses [Titanium](https://cloud.google.com/titanium) to deliver more compute and memory resources for your workloads by offloading network and I/O processing from the host hardware. To learn more, see [C4D machine series](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/general-purpose-machines#c4d_series). For information about bare metal instances, including regional availability, see [Bare metal instances on Compute Engine](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/bare-metal-instances#c4d-metal).</content>
    <summary>The new C4D machine series, featuring AMD EPYC processors, is now generally available. These bare metal instances provide direct access to hardware resources, offering enhanced performance for demanding workloads. The series includes standard, high-CPU, and high-memory configurations.</summary>

    <content type="text/markdown">Compute flexible committed use discounts (CUDs) offer expanded coverage by
supporting the following resources and services:

* Memory-optimized M1, M2, M3, and M4 VMs
* Compute-optimized H3 instances
* Cloud Run services with request-based billing
* Cloud Run Functions

To receive the expanded coverage for flexible CUDs, you must opt in to the new
spend-based CUD model. Cloud Billing accounts that meet specific criteria are
automatically opted into the new model. On January 21, 2026, all remaining
accounts will automatically migrate to the new model. You can opt in before that
date to start receiving the expanded coverage. To learn more about the new model
and the opt-in details, see
[Spend-based CUDs program improvements](https://cloud.google.com/docs/cuds-multiprice).

To learn more about this change and how your flexible CUDs apply after you opt
in, see
[Compute flexible CUDs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/committed-use-discounts-overview#spend_based).</content>
    <summary>Compute flexible committed use discounts now cover memory-optimized VMs (M1-M4), compute-optimized H3 instances, and Cloud Run services.

    <content type="text/markdown">**Preview**: You can reserve GPU VMs that use A4 and A3 Ultra machine types by using future reservations in calendar mode. This feature lets you reserve up to 80 GPU VMs for up to 90 days to obtain capacity for the following workloads:

* Model pre-training jobs
* Model fine-tuning jobs
* High performance computing (HPC) simulation workloads
* Short-term expected increases in inference workloads

    <content type="text/markdown">**Generally available**: You can create Z3 VMs using smaller machine types, ranging in size from 14 to 88 vCPUs. Also, Z3 now offers `-standardlssd` and `-highlssd` predefined machine types. These new machine types have different amounts of Local SSD capacity per vCPU.

When you use Local SSD disks with Z3 VMs, you can receive committed use discounts (CUDs) without needing to [attach reservations to your commitments](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/reservations-with-commitments#committed_resources_that_require_attached_reservations).

For more information, see [Storage-optimized machines](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/storage-optimized-machines).</content>
    <summary>Z3 VMs now support a wider range of machine types, from 14 to 88 vCPUs, including new predefined machine types with varying Local SSD capacities. Additionally, using Local SSDs with Z3 VMs now qualifies for committed use discounts without requiring reservation attachments.</summary>

    <content type="text/markdown">**Generally available**: You can now modify licenses attached to your disks. Previously, licenses on disk resources were immutable. You had to delete and recreate disks, or engage our support team to change licenses.

This feature provides greater flexibility for managing your disk licenses. You can now:

* Append, remove, replace, and view the history of license updates.
* Perform in-place license upgrades, such as [Ubuntu to Ubuntu Pro](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/premium/ubuntu-pro/upgrade-from-ubuntu), using the `gcloud` CLI and REST.
* [Switch from PAYG to BYOS billing](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/licenses/switch-between-payg-and-byos) models.
* Review [license changes and restrictions](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/licenses/license-changes-and-restrictions) and [append a RHEL ELS](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/premium/rhel/append-els-licenses) license to a newer version.

    <content type="text/markdown">**Preview**: Dynamic NICs let you add or remove network interfaces to or from an instance without having to restart or recreate the instance.

You can also use Dynamic NICs when you need more network interfaces. The maximum number of vNICs for most machine types in Google Cloud is 10; however, you can configure up to 16 total interfaces by using Dynamic NICs.

For more information, see the following:

* [Multiple network interfaces overview](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/multiple-interfaces-concepts)
