    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Previously, data quality scan results were published only to the Google Cloud console. You can now publish the results of a data quality scan as Dataplex Universal Catalog metadata. The latest results are saved to the entry that represents the source table. You can view the results in the Google Cloud console.</p>
<p>If you want to enable catalog publishing for an existing data quality scan, you must edit the scan and re-enable the publishing option.</p>
