Language is no longer a barrier!\n* **Enhanced Audio Quality:** Experience a dramatically improved audio quality that truly feels like speaking with a person.\n* **Proactive Audio:** Define Gemini's expertise and set conditions for when it should respond. Gemini can act as a \"silent listener,\" only chiming in when the conversation touches upon its designated area of expertise.\n* **Affective Dialog:** Gemini can adapt and adjust its generated voice to match the emotional tone of the speaker, creating more empathetic and natural interactions.\n\n[Watch our comprehensive demo](https://youtu.be/ZsB33Tr-P3c) to see these features in action, including seamless language switching, expert mode, emotionally aware responses, memory recall, and interactive screen sharing for engineering tasks – all demonstrated directly within Vertex AI Studio without writing a single line of code!",
