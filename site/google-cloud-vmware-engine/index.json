After that, Google Cloud will not be able to sell new VMware Engine VCF license-included nodes. You can buy new VMware Engine BYOL nodes and use them with \"bring your own\" VCF subscriptions (purchased by you from Broadcom) for new capacity after **October 15, 2025**.\n\nFor any questions, please reach out to your Google Cloud sales team, who can help review your specific scenarios, discuss the implications of these changes for your organization, and help you manage this transition.\n\nFor more details, see the [October 3, 2025](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vmware-engine/docs/service-announcements#2025-10-03) service announcement.",
