<li><strong>Auto-renewal of TLS certificates for Symcloud Storage no longer fails.</strong> Symcloud Storage host services no longer
  report a <code>Critical</code> state if a Google Distributed Cloud connected node was restarted after the Symcloud Storage TLS
  certificate has expired. These certificates now renew automatically when the Google Distributed Cloud connected software
  on the cluster is upgraded.</li>

  Disk initialization jobs now automatically retry until they succeed if transient control plane instability causes them to fail.</li>
<li><strong>Single-node cluster upgrades no longer fail due to race conditions.</strong> A number of bugs in
  <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc"><code>runc</code></a> have been resolved, eliminating
  race conditions that caused single-node cluster upgrade failures.</li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This release of Google Distributed Cloud connected contains the following known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symcloud Storage pods can enter a <code>CrashLoopBackOff</code> state due to bootstrapping failures.</strong>. The Symcloud Storage
  worker pods can intermittently restart multiple times while bootstrapping, preventing the <code>config.ini</code> file from being
  generated, which causes the pods to fail repeatedly. To remedy this issue, contact
  <a href="https://docs.cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/getting-support">Google Support</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Symcloud Storage jobs can stall due to thread lock contention.</strong> A race condition caused by lock contention between
  multiple threads can prevent Symcloud Storage jobs, such as volume attachment, detachment, creation, or deletion to stall.
  To remedy this issue, contact <a href="https://docs.cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/getting-support">Google Support</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Symcloud Storage activation can stall due to scheduling conflicts following transient pre-install job failures.</strong>
  The pre-installation job does not tolerate transient failures, such as <code>containerd</code> issues. If a job pod fails but isn't
  automatically deleted, existing pod affinity constraints prevent a replacement pod from being scheduled. This leaves the
  job incomplete and stalls the Symcloud Storage activation process. To remedy this issue, contact
  <a href="https://docs.cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/getting-support">Google Support</a>.</li>
<li><strong><code>RobinCluster</code> status updates can be delayed after reconciliation.</strong> The <code>RobinCluster</code> status may not immediately
  reflect a Ready state even after reconciliation has completed. This delay occurs because the Symcloud Storage Operator's
  back-off timer can increase to over 10 minutes during reconciliation, causing a lag in reporting the final status.</li>
<li><strong>Network Operator metrics missing in Cloud Monitoring.</strong> Metrics for Network Function operators are not reported in
  Cloud Monitoring if the Google Cloud project hosting the cluster exceeds its Cloud Monitoring API ingestion quota limits.
  To remedy this issue, review your Cloud Monitoring API quota usage. If you consistently reach the limits, request a quota
  increase through the Google Cloud Console.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
    <summary>This release of Distributed Cloud Connected has several known issues affecting Symcloud Storage, including pods entering a crash loop, jobs stalling due to thread lock contention, and activation stalls. Additionally, RobinCluster status updates can be delayed, and Network Operator metrics may be missing in Cloud Monitoring under certain quota conditions.</summary>

<li><strong>Improved reliability of virtual machine workloads.</strong> This release addresses Symcloud Storage issues contributing to
  freezing and slow recovery of VM workloads: <code>iomgr</code> <code>bmap</code> cache assertion, <code>bmap</code> repopulation performance, and <code>bmap</code>
  garbage collection performance.</li>
<li><strong>Virtual machine workloads no longer throw a <code>SyncFailed</code> error when reading large amounts of remote data.</strong> A race
  condition was resolved that caused virtual machine workloads to stop responding to their clients if the network connection
  failed when reading large amounts of data remotely. The race condition caused the virtual machine to become unhealthy and
  report the following event: <code>SyncFailed virt-handler unknown error encountered sending command SyncVMI: rpc error: code = DeadlineExceeded desc = context deadline exceeded</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Patroni cluster now synchronizes properly when restarted after an ungraceful shutdown.</strong> If the Patroni cluster was not gracefully
  shut down, it could fail to synchronize correctly upon restart, leading to an outage of the Robin Service.</li>
<li><strong>Symcloud Storage pods now start up properly even if some pods are not ready when a node is cordoned or terminated.</strong> The Patroni
  <code>StatefulSet</code> used the <code>Ordered</code> pod management policy, which prevented remaining pods from starting up if the previous pod wasn't ready.
  The updated policy now allows each pod to recover regardless of the state of the other pods.</li>
</ul>]]></content>
    <summary>This release addresses several critical issues, including failures in single-node cluster upgrades, intermittent virtual machine freezes, and errors during remote data reads. Additionally, Patroni cluster synchronization and Symcloud Storage pod startup have been improved for greater reliability.</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This release of Google Distributed Cloud connected contains the following known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Robin Service fails after restarting a worker node due to expired TLS certificates.</strong> Symcloud Storage TLS certificates
  do not auto-renew. If a worker pod is restarted while the corresponding certificate is expired, all Robin host services report

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This release of Google Distributed Cloud connected contains the following known issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The <code>gvisor</code> runtime class is incompatible with Symcloud Storage persistent volumes in block mode.</strong> If you set a workload that uses Symcloud Storage persistent volumes in block mode to use the <code>gvisor</code> runtime class, the workload fails. Symcloud Storage persistent volumes in filesystem mode are not affected.</li>
<li><strong>Cilium does not differentiate between TCP and UDP protocols.</strong> Cilium does not differentiate between TCP and UDP protocols for services that use both protocols on the same port number and routes traffic for both protocols to the same backend pods. This can render such services non-functional. To work around this issue, use a different port for each protocol.</li>
<li><strong>Overlapping the Pod and cluster CIDR blocks for secondary networks causes network failure.</strong> If you specify overlapping CIDR blocks for Pods and clusters using the <code>annotations.networking.gke.io/gdce-pod-cidr</code> and <code>annotations.networking.gke.io/gke-gateway-clusterip-cidr</code> annotations in the <code>Network</code> resource, the Google Distributed Cloud connected virtual networking subsystem might behave erratically, including loss of connectivity. Follow the guidelines in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/networking#island-mode">(Optional) Configure island mode</a> to prevent this issue.</li>
<li><strong>The <code>anthos-multinet</code> container might take up to two hours to fully start.</strong> You might intermittently experience a slower than normal startup for the <code>anthos-multinet</code> container (up to two hours). To remedy this issue, contact <a href="https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/getting-support">Google Support</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Configurable per-node subnet mask size.</strong> The <code>Network</code> Network Function operator resource now allows you to configure the subnet mask size for each node. For more information, see <a href="https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/network-function#Network"><code>Network</code> resource</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Raw workload log export.</strong> You can now access raw (unprocessed and untagged) workload logs for your Pods for export to your own log processor.
