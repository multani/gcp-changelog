For more information, see [Availability best practices](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/availability).\n* **VM management in Cloud Console for GDCc servers.** You can now manage virtual machine workloads running on your Google Distributed Cloud connected servers deployments through the Cloud Console. For more information, see [Manage virtual machines on Distributed Cloud connected servers](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/vm-servers).\n* **Kernel memory accounting control.** You can now configure the `NodeSystemConfigUpdate` Network Function operator resource to exclude kernel-space memory from Pod memory usage calculation. For more information, see [`NodeSystemConfigUpdate` resource](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/network-function#NodeSystemConfigUpdate).\n* **Configurable per-node subnet mask size.** The `Network` Network Function operator resource now allows you to configure the subnet mask size for each node. For more information, see [`Network` resource](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/network-function#Network).\n* **Raw workload log export.** You can now access raw (unprocessed and untagged) workload logs for your Pods for export to your own log processor. For more information, see [Collect raw workload logs for external processing](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/logs-metrics#collect_raw_workload_logs_for_external_processing).",

To remedy this issue, contact [Google Support](https://cloud.google.com/distributed-cloud/edge/latest/docs/getting-support).\n* **Virtual machine workloads cannot coexist on the same virtual network with Pods that use DHCP for IP address assignment.** This is because virtual machine workloads need the `IPAMMode` parameter set to `external` to use DHCP, while Pods need the `IPAMMode` parameter set to `internal` to use DHCP. Pods with static IP address are not affected by this. This behavior is by design.",
