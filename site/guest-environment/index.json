This framework\n  lets you set the logging level in the\n  [guest agent configuration file](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/manage-guest-agent#update-guest-agent-config).\n  For more information about the logging options, see [core settings](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/manage-guest-agent#core)\n  in the configuration options table.\n* The workload refresh service `gce-workload-cert-refresher` is now part of the\n  guest agent's core plugin. It is no longer a separate systemd service.\n* The guest agent updates the metadata script runner and the Authorized Keys\n  binary (Windows only) to use the new, configurable logging framework.\n  Compatibility managers are included to facilitate the migration.",
