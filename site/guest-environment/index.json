For more information about the plugin-based architecture, see [Guest agent](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/guest-agent).\n\n* The Clock Skew module no longer causes time inconsistencies on VMs. The agent no longer attempts to synchronize the hardware clock (`hwclock`) when the VM's Real-time Clock (RTC) isn't set to Coordinated Universal Time 0(UTC). For more information about how the guest agent handles clock synchronization, see [Clock Synchronization](https://docs.cloud.google.com/compute/docs/images/guest-agent-functions#clock-synchronization).\n* The [Dynamic VLAN](https://docs.cloud.google.com/network-connectivity/docs/interconnect/how-to/dedicated/creating-vlan-attachments) module now correctly sets up VLAN network interface cards (NICs). Dynamic VLAN connections now initialize reliably.\n* The agent now prevents a race condition in network interface and route setup. Previously, routes were temporarily flushed if they were added before a DHCP lease was acquired. The agent now ensures routes persist correctly, preventing a brief period of missing routes. These routes were previously auto-corrected after approximately one minute.",
