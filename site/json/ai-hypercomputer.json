By creating a request in calendar mode, you can reserve up to 80 GPU VMs for a future date and time. Then, you can use that capacity to run the following workloads:\n\n* Model pre-training\n* Model fine-tuning\n* Simulations\n* Inference\n\nFor more information, see [Choose a consumption option](https://cloud.google.com/ai-hypercomputer/docs/consumption-models)."

Workload policies help improve the workload performance by optimizing the underlying infrastructure. The supported type, `high-throughput`, is ideal for workloads that require high networking performance. For more information, see [Workload policy for MIGs](https://cloud.google.com/ai-hypercomputer/docs/placement-policy-and-workload-policy#workload-policy)."
