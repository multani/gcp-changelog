This endpoint is a global domain name service (DNS) name and resolves to the IP address of the current primary Cloud SQL instance that's enabled with private services access.\n\nBy using a write endpoint, you can avoid having to make application connection changes after performing a switchover or replica failover operation to test or mitigate a regional failure.\n\nFor more information, see [Connect to an instance using a write endpoint](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/postgres/connect-to-instance-using-write-endpoint)."
