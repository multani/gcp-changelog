For example, GitSync now uses this capability to synchronize playbooks with restricted permissions.\n\nFor more information on how playbook permissions work with users and API keys, see [Playbook permissions](http://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/soar/respond/working-with-playbooks/playbook-permissions).\n\nFor specific instructions on configuring GitSync with restricted playbooks, see [GitSync - Work with playbook permissions](https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/soar/marketplace/power-ups/gitsync#work-with-playbook-permissions)."
