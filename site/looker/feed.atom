    <content type="text/markdown">The [Embed SDK](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/embed-sdk-intro) has been upgraded to release 2.0.0. While the 2.0.0 API is backwards-compatible with Embed SDK 1.8.x, the underlying implementation has changed for some functionality. SDK 1.8.x exported a number of classes. SDK 2.0.0 replaces these classes with interfaces that are marked as deprecated (alternative interfaces are identified). We recommend that applications use the interfaces that have an 'I' prefix (the interfaces that have prefixes are identical to the interfaces that don't have them). Applications that are upgraded to SDK 2.0.0 should continue to work and behave as they did previously. To take advantage of the API improvements, some refactoring will be required. The following major changes are included in Embed SDK 2.0.0:

* Navigating between dashboards, Explores, and Looks no longer requires that an iframe be recreated. Instead, the `loadDashboard`, `loadLook`, `loadExplore`, and `loadUrl` methods can be used to navigate within the Looker iframe.
* `connect` now returns a unified connection rather than a connection that is related only to a dashboard, a Look, or an Explore. The unified connection allows embedding applications to detect a user navigating inside the iframe.
* Support for additional Looker embedded content has been added for Looker reports and query visualizations.

    <content type="text/markdown">For period-over-period (PoP) measures, a new subparameter, [`value_to_date`](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/period-over-period#value_to_date), is available. When a PoP measure is defined with `value_to_date:yes`, Looker will calculate the amount of time in the current timeframe at the time that the query is run and apply that amount of time when it calculates the values for previous periods.</content>

    <content type="text/markdown">The Looker [Continuous Integration (CI)](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/continuous-integration) features let you run tests on your LookML project to deliver more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly data experiences. You can use the CI validators to catch issues with SQL, data test, content, and LookML before they hit production to verify your LookML and prevent query errors for your users. You can also configure the CI validators to run automatically when a pull request is submitted to your LookML repository. **Note:** This item was added on June 23, 2025.</content>

    <content type="text/markdown">The [Code Interpreter in Conversational Analytics](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/studio/conversational-analytics-code-interpreter) is now available in [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). The Code Interpreter translates your natural language questions into Python code and executes that code to provide advanced analysis and visualizations. The Code Interpreter is disabled by default. Admins of Looker (Google Cloud core) instances can manage enablement for the Code Interpreter on the [Gemini in Looker admin page](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/looker-core-admin-gemini#enable-ci-core). **Note:** This item was added on June 23, 2025.</content>

    <content type="text/markdown">Gemini in Looker will be enabled by default for Looker (original) instances that meet at least one of the following criteria:

* The Automated Gemini in Looker enablement and user management setting on the Settings page in the Looker Admin panel was previously enabled.
* The instance is updated to Looker 25.6 or later after June 9, 2025.

Instances that are hosted in the [EMEA region](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/looker-original-locations) and those that are enrolled in Looker's [Extended Support Release (ESR) program](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/standard-extended-support-release-program-overview) are exempt from automatic enablement.

Looker admins can still manage Gemini in Looker enablement manually on the [Gemini in Looker](https://cloud.google.com/looker/docs/admin-panel-platform-gil) page in the Admin panel.</content>
