    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Preview:</strong> Eight new organization policy constraints are available to help you
enforce security best practices for Compute Engine virtual machine (VM)
instances.</p>
<p>These <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/using-constraints#managed-constraints">managed constraints</a>
simplify governance for common security scenarios and integrate with safe
rollout tools like
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/dry-run-policy">dry-run</a>
and
<a href="https://cloud.google.com/policy-intelligence/docs/test-organization-policies">simulation</a>,
letting you test their impact before enforcement.</p>
<p>The new constraints are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>compute.managed.disableNestedVirtualization</code></li>
<li><code>compute.managed.disableSerialPortAccess</code></li>
<li><code>compute.managed.disableSerialPortLogging</code></li>
<li><code>compute.managed.disallowGlobalDns</code></li>

<li><code>compute.managed.requireOsLogin</code></li>
<li><code>compute.managed.vmCanIpForward</code></li>
<li><code>compute.managed.vmExternalIpAccess</code></li>

<p>These constraints can evaluate metadata values at the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/metadata/overview#metadata-directories">VM instance, project, or

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Certain Organization Policy <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview#managed-constraints">managed constraints</a> that were released on August 21, 2025 were not functioning as intended. The Organization Policy Service evaluated these constraints as if the <code>effectiveInstanceMetadata</code> field of the resources that they were enforced on was empty, causing them to always evaluate to either allow or deny access to the resource.</p>
<p>The following managed constraints were evaluated to always allow creation of resources where they were enforced:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>constraints/compute.managed.disableGuestAttributesAccess</code></li>
<li><code>constraints/compute.managed.disableSerialPortAccess</code></li>
<li><code>constraints/compute.managed.disableSerialPortLogging</code></li>
</ul>
<p>The following managed constraints were evaluated to always block creation of resources where they were enforced:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>constraints/compute.managed.disallowGlobalDns</code></li>
<li><code>constraints/compute.managed.requireOsConfig</code></li>
<li><code>constraints/compute.managed.requireOsLogin</code></li>
</ul>
<p>This issue has been corrected, and these constraints now properly evaluate the <code>effectiveInstanceMetadata</code> field to determine whether resource creation should be allowed or blocked.</p>]]></content>
    <summary>Certain Organization Policy managed constraints released on August 21, 2025, had a bug and were not functioning as intended. This has now been corrected and the constraints are working as expected.</summary>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Organization policies in dry-run mode are reporting inconsistent results for the following <a href="https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview#managed_constraints">managed constraints</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>constraints/compute.managed.restrictProtocolForwardingCreationForTypes</code></li>
<li><code>constraints/iam.managed.allowedPolicyMembers</code></li>
<li><code>constraints/essentialcontacts.managed.allowedContactDomains</code></li>
<li><code>constraints/compute.managed.blockPreviewFeatures</code></li>
</ul>
<p>If a resource inherited an organization policy in dry-run mode that uses any of these managed constraints, that dry-run policy was evaluated without using the parameters specified in the live policy. Normally, an organization policy in dry-run mode that's inherited on a resource is overridden by the live organization policy set directly on that same resource. Not evaluating the live organization policy parameters in the inherited organization policy in dry-run mode led to inconsistent results.</p>
<p>Our engineering team is working to resolve this issue.</p>]]></content>
