Note: Rollouts of this release to production instances will begin within two business days and may take four or more business days to complete across all Google Cloud zones. Your instances may not have the feature available until the rollout is complete. Feature New model for Abuse Detection's Advanced Anomaly Detection rule With this release, we introduced a new and improved machine learning model for anomaly detection in Advanced API Security. This new model includes the following improvements: Trained on customer-specific traffic patterns. The new model is trained exclusively on your organization's historical API traffic data. It continues to learn from your API traffic patterns over time to increase accuracy. Engineered by Google for anomaly detection. The new model is a custom Vertex AI-based machine learning model, engineered and also used internally by Google specifically to detect anomalies in traffic patterns. Usage requirements: In order to use this new model, you must explicitly opt in to allow the model to use your traffic and other data to train for anomaly detection. Note that your data is never shared with other customers for training purposes. The new model is not available for VPC-SC customers at this time. The new anomaly detection model replaces the old model, with no customer-facing changes to the API or UI. Upon opting in for model training, you can expect to start seeing detected anomalies within 6 hours. If you have already opted in to allow the older version of our anomaly detection model to use your traffic data for training, you will not need to opt in again. For more information on this model and on Abuse Detection, see Abuse Detection customer documentation , including Detection rules . 2025-05-27 Announcement On May 27, 2025 we released an updated version of Apigee Advanced API Security.

This new model includes the following improvements: Trained on customer-specific traffic patterns. The new model is trained exclusively on your organization's historical API traffic data. It continues to learn from your API traffic patterns over time to increase accuracy. Engineered by Google for anomaly detection. The new model is a custom Vertex AI-based machine learning model, engineered and also used internally by Google specifically to detect anomalies in traffic patterns. Usage requirements: In order to use this new model, you must explicitly opt in to allow the model to use your traffic and other data to train for anomaly detection. Note that your data is never shared with other customers for training purposes. The new model is not available for VPC-SC customers at this time. The new anomaly detection model replaces the old model, with no customer-facing changes to the API or UI. Upon opting in for model training, you can expect to start seeing detected anomalies within 6 hours. If you have already opted in to allow the older version of our anomaly detection model to use your traffic data for training, you will not need to opt in again.

Feature Push-based plugin ingestion API hub now supports push-based plugin ingestion. This method allows for more real-time synchronization of API metadata. All new Apigee, Apigee hybrid, Apigee Edge Public Cloud, and Apigee Edge Private Cloud (OPDK) plugins are created with push-based ingestion by default. For more information, see Plugin data ingestion methods . Note: Rollouts of this feature will begin today, and may take five or more business days to be completed across all Google Cloud zones. You may not be able to create push-based plugins until the rollout is complete. Feature Create custom plugins [API only] You can now use the Create Plugin API to create custom plugins in API hub. Custom plugins are created manually to connect API hub to a specific API data source. For more information, see Create custom plugins . Issue Default Apigee plugin instance not auto-created during runtime attachment Issue: When provisioning API hub as part of Apigee provisioning, the default Apigee X and hybrid plugin instance is not automatically created. This prevents API proxies from being auto-registered. Workaround: You can manually attach an Apigee runtime instance and import the Apigee assets. See Attach a runtime project . Changed Delete plugin instance changes API hub no longer retains any ingested metadata from a plugin after its deletion. Deleting a plugin instance also permanently deletes all the associated API data from API hub. For more information, see Delete a plugin instance . Changed Provisioning changes and Apigee API proxy registration API hub changed how it registers API proxies from Apigee and how it creates default plugin instances during provisioning. API hub now automatically creates a default Apigee X and hybrid plugin instance and auto-registers API proxies only when you provision it as part of Apigee provisioning. If you provision API hub directly from the API hub UI, API hub does not automatically create a default plugin instance, nor does it auto-register proxies. For more information, see Project attachments and plugins . Changed New tutorial: Enrich API data in API hub A new tutorial is available for enriching API data in Apigee API hub. It shows you how to use API hub's custom curation features to automatically fetch OpenAPI specifications from a Cloud Storage bucket and associate them with their corresponding Apigee API proxies. The custom curation logic is defined using an integration in Application Integration. For more information, see Enrich API data with custom curation in API hub . Deprecated Deprecation of pull-based ingestion for Apigee plugins Pull-based ingestion is no longer supported for Apigee and Apigee hybrid plugins as of July 31, 2025 . For existing projects that have pull-based Apigee X and hybrid plugins configured, these plugins will continue to function and will be automatically migrated to the push-based type starting August 2025 . Deprecated Deprecation of Apigee proxy deployment attributes As of July 31st, 2025 , the Apigee X and Hybrid Environment and Apigee X and Hybrid Organization attributes will no longer be added to new Apigee proxy deployments. This change specifically applies when you import deployments into API hub by attaching a runtime project. If your existing projects use these attributes in filtered search queries, we recommend updating them. To ensure your searches continue to work, use the Source project and Source environment fields as alternatives. 2025-07-22 Changed API hub provisioning now enables Apigee API When you provision API hub, it now enables the Apigee API ( apigee.googleapis.com ) in your Google Cloud project. If Apigee isn't already provisioned, an Apigee organization is also automatically created in your project as part of the provisioning process. API hub remains a free service. Enabling the Apigee API has no additional pricing or billing implications for your project. For more information, see Provision API hub in the Cloud console . Changed API hub deprovisioning changes Deprovisioning an API hub instance now also deletes any associated Apigee organizations from your Google Cloud project, provided those Apigee organizations have no Apigee instances. If you deprovision an API hub instance, you can reprovision it later, but you'll need to wait 7 days before you can do so. For more information, see Deprovision Apigee API hub . Changed VPC Service Controls (VPC-SC) is GA VPC Service Controls in API hub is now GA . For more information, see VPC Service Controls for API hub . 2025-07-18 Feature Apigee and hybrid plugin instance management You can now create and delete plugin instances for Apigee and Apigee Hybrid while associating the respective Apigee runtime projects to API hub. For more information, see Auto-register Apigee proxies . Breaking Apigee and Apigee hybrid plugin creation now requires source project ID When creating new instances of the Apigee X and hybrid plugin, you must now provide a source project ID. This source project ID is the Google Cloud project from which the plugin will import data. This is a breaking change and will affect any existing API calls that create these plugins without explicitly providing this ID. Action Required: Update your API calls to include the appropriate source project ID when creating new Apigee X and hybrid plugins. Failing to do so will result in creation errors. Changed Edit plugin instances changes You can now change or modify the name and curation logic of your plugin instance. For more information, see Edit a plugin instance . Changed Resource URI format for Apigee deployments To ensure optimal functionality and consistency while creating or updating Apigee deployments, we now recommend that the Resource URI conforms to the following format: organizations/([^/]+)/environments/([^/]+)/apis/([^/]+)$ For more information, see Introduction to deployments . 2025-06-03 Announcement On June 3, 2025, we released an updated version of Apigee. Feature Apigee API hub is enabled for new Apigee organizations in supported regions. With this release, we are enabling Apigee API hub for new Apigee organizations in regions where API hub is supported . All new Apigee organizations, including hybrid organizations, that select an API hub-supported region for their Apigee Analytics region during provisioning will have access to API hub features at no additional cost. API hub allows you to view, organize, and manage all of the APIs in your Apigee organization in one central location. To learn more, see What is Apigee API hub? No action on your part is required to provision API hub for your organization, with the following exceptions: If your Apigee organization has Data Residency or VPC Service Controls enabled, you must configure your API hub instance manually to support these services. See VPC Service Controls for API hub and API hub and data residency for more information. If your Apigee organization uses Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK), you must deprovision the Apigee API hub instance provided by default and recreate it to support CMEK.

Your instances may not have the features and fixes available until the rollout is complete. Feature Server-sent events and EventFlows are Generally Available (GA) Apigee supports continuous response streaming from server-sent event (SSE) endpoints to clients in real time. The Apigee SSE feature is useful for handling large language model (LLM) APIs that operate most effectively by streaming their responses back to the client. SSE streaming reduces latency, and clients can receive response data as soon as it is generated by an LLM. This feature supports the use of AI agents that operate in real time environments, such as customer service bots or workflow orchestrators. For more information, see Streaming server-sent events . Streaming from SSE endpoints is available in Apigee and in Apigee hybrid v1.15.0 and newer. Fixed Bug ID Description 422195061 Enhanced cache lookup performance. 269573358 Resolved issue with OASValidation policy schema references for parameters without body validation The OASValidation policy correctly resolves and validates schemas passed by reference ( $ref ) for header, path, and query parameters, even when the flag is set to false . 421141062 Increased OAS validation limit to 20MB in JSON payloads to prevent validation failures. 417200603 Improved API connection stability to prevent premature timeouts for long-running requests. 423597917 POST operations for AppGroupApp keys updated POST operations for AppGroup app keys now insert scopes and attributes instead of appending these values.

Feature Apigee API hub is enabled for new Apigee organizations in supported regions. With this release, we are enabling Apigee API hub for new Apigee organizations in regions where API hub is supported . All new Apigee organizations, including hybrid organizations, that select an API hub-supported region for their Apigee Analytics region during provisioning will have access to API hub features at no additional cost. API hub allows you to view, organize, and manage all of the APIs in your Apigee organization in one central location. To learn more, see What is Apigee API hub? No action on your part is required to provision API hub for your organization, with the following exceptions: If your Apigee organization has Data Residency or VPC Service Controls enabled, you must configure your API hub instance manually to support these services. See VPC Service Controls for API hub and API hub and data residency for more information. If your Apigee organization uses Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK), you must deprovision the Apigee API hub instance provided by default and recreate it to support CMEK. See Deprovision Apigee API hub and Provision API hub in the Cloud console for step-by-step instructions.

SSE streaming reduces latency, and clients can receive response data as soon as it is generated by an LLM. This feature supports the use of AI agents that operate in real time environments, such as customer service bots or workflow orchestrators. For more information, see Streaming server-sent events .

This enables advanced data protection capabilities offered by Backup and DR including backup vault support, granular scheduling through backup plans, and centralized management. 2025-07-11 Announcement We're excited to announce the launch of Editable Backup Plans, a new feature designed to give you more flexibility and control over your data protection strategy. You can now modify your existing backup plans directly, eliminating the need to create new plans and reassign them when your requirements change. This makes it easier than ever to adapt to evolving business needs, optimize for cost, and correct configuration errors on the fly. What's new: Directly Edit Key Settings: You can now change the description, schedule, backup window, and retention periods of your existing backup plans. You can also add or remove backup rules as needed. Automatic Updates: Once a plan is edited, the changes are automatically applied to all resources protected by that plan for all future backups. There's no need to manually detach and reattach the plan. Backward Compatibility: This new capability is available for all backup plans, including those created before this update. Important Note: While most settings in a backup plan are now editable, the assigned backup vault cannot be changed. To store backups in a different vault, a new backup plan must be created.","title":"Backup and DR"},{"location":"backup-and-dr/#backup-and-dr","text":"","title":"Backup and DR"},{"location":"backup-and-dr/#2025-07-31","text":"","title":"2025-07-31"},{"location":"backup-and-dr/#announcement","text":"Announcing the Public Preview launch of Cloud SQL enhanced backups with Backup and DR.

Changed New Airflow builds are available in Cloud Composer 3: composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.10 (default) composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.30 Changed New images are available in Cloud Composer 2: composer-2.13.8-airflow-2.10.5 (default) composer-2.13.8-airflow-2.9.3 Deprecated Cloud Composer version 2.8.6 has reached its end of support period . 2025-07-24 Feature Web server restarting is is now generally available (GA) in Cloud Composer 2 and Cloud Composer 3. 2025-07-23 Announcement If your environment uses dag-factory package version 0.22, then you might experience DAG failures in Cloud Composer versions that have apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes package version 10.4.2 or later. At the same time, upgrading the dag-factory package to version 0.23 might require you to update your DAG code to make it compatible. If your environment uses dag-factory version 0.22, we recommend to do the following: Temporarily postpone upgrading your environment until you're ready to switch to dag-factory version 0.23. Last versions of Cloud Composer that support version 0.22 are composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.3, composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.23, composer-2.13.1-airflow-2.10.5, and composer-2.13.1-airflow-2.9.3 released on May 14, 2025. When you are ready to upgrade, update your DAGs for compatibility with 0.23. We recommend to do this in a development environment first. Install dag-factory version 0.23, then check that your DAGs are parsed and are working correctly, and update them if needed. After your DAGs are compatible, install dag-factory version 0.23 in your production environment and transfer the updated DAGs. Your environment can now be upgraded to a later version of Cloud Composer or Airflow. If your environment is already upgraded to a later version of Cloud Composer and you experience problems, then update dag-factory to version 0.23 and update your DAGs for compatibility with 0.23. 2025-07-17 Feature Highly resilient environments are now generally available (GA) in Cloud Composer 3. 2025-07-14 Changed We're changing the way we provide support dates for Airflow builds in Cloud Composer 3. Before this change, some Airflow builds had their end of support date listed as \"To be announced\" until a later Airflow version became available. We're deprecating this approach for all builds that are released after July 01, 2025. We are now providing support dates that depend on a date when a particular Airflow build was released: We are introducing the standard support period of 12 months after the release date. All Airflow builds that didn't have an end of support date when this change was introduced are supported until July 1, 2026. Because of this change, some Airflow builds released before July 1, 2025 are supported for longer than the standard support period. All Airflow builds that had their support date shorter than 12 months are now supported for 12 months since the date of their initial release. All builds released after July 1, 2025 will use the standard support period. 2025-07-09 Announcement A new Cloud Composer release has started on July 9, 2025 . Get ready for upcoming changes and features as we roll out the new release to all regions. This release is in progress at the moment. Listed changes and features might not be available in some regions yet. Changed We are gradually rolling out a change that switches the default version from Cloud Composer 2 to Cloud Composer 3 in the Cloud Composer API. In regions where the change is rolled out, a Cloud Composer 3 environment is created by default when a version is not specified in Google Cloud CLI, Cloud Composer API, or Terraform. If you use automation scripts to provision Cloud Composer 2 environments, make sure that you explicitly specify a Cloud Composer 2 version. In this release, the change is rolling out in the following regions: africa-south1, asia-northeast2, asia-south2, asia-southeast2, europe-southwest1, europe-west10, europe-west12, europe-west8, me-central1, me-central2, me-west1, southamerica-west1, and us-south1.

Starting February 27, 2026 , the following APIs will become fully detachable . Deactivating these APIs won't cause the deactivation of the Cloud Composer API: artifactregistry.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com sqladmin.googleapis.com Starting May 27, 2026 , these APIs will no longer be enabled automatically when you enable the Cloud Composer API. To create Cloud Composer 2 environments in new projects, the group of detached APIs must be enabled manually. Existing Cloud Composer 3 and Cloud Composer 2 environments in projects where the Cloud Composer API is already enabled will not be impacted. You can do the following: After February 27, 2026 , if your project has only Cloud Composer 3 environments, then you can manually disable the detached APIs. After February 27, 2026 , if your project has Cloud Composer 2 environments, then we recommend keeping these APIs enabled because disabling them might lead to environment's malfunction. After May 27, 2026 , if you use automation scripts to provision Cloud Composer 2 environments, then make sure that the listed APIs are enabled in addition to the Cloud Composer API. 2025-06-13 Feature Cloud Composer pages in the Cloud Console now support the dark color theme. You can switch to the dark theme on the Appearance page in the Cloud Console. 2025-06-10 Announcement A new Cloud Composer release has started on June 10, 2025 .

Changed (Cloud Composer 3) If a VPC network is attached to an environment, then all DNS addresses accessed by the Airflow components of the environment are resolved using the Cloud DNS configuration of the VPC network. In particular, Airflow workers that execute DAGs will resolve DNS addresses in this way. Changed (Cloud Composer 3) All newly created private DNS zones are immediately visible to a Cloud Composer environment. Previously, re-attaching a VPC network was required. Fixed (Cloud Composer 3) It's now possible to use zones with cross-project binding . Before this change, cross-project bound zones weren't supported in Cloud Composer 3. Changed (Cloud Composer 2) In Cloud Composer versions 2.11.5 and later, log processing is switching to using OpenTelemetry instead of Fluentd.

For more information, see Set up a cross-region internal Application Load Balancer with Cloud Storage buckets . This capability is now in General Availability . 2025-07-30 Changed Starting October 15, 2025, the global and classic external Application Load Balancers are improving HTTP header handling for headers with obs-fold values to comply with the RFC 9112 standard Previously, these load balancers would forward HTTP headers with obs-fold values (those split across multiple lines, with subsequent lines starting with a space or a tab) without any changes. Starting October 15, 2025, each obs-fold will be replaced with one or more space characters (SP octets) before forwarding the message upstream. This ensures that the header is correctly interpreted as a single line, as required by the HTTP specification. What you need to do Review your current client applications and backend services before October 15, 2025 and ensure that they generate HTTP headers with obs-fold values in a single-line format when communicating with these load balancers. Because the obs-fold header fields have been deprecated in RFC 9112, compliant clients and servers should already avoid using this format. However, there is a possibility that services that specifically rely on the old, non-compliant multi-line format of headers with obs-fold values might experience unexpected behavior. You should proactively check your backend service logs for any errors originating from your services due to the modified obs-fold headers. For more information on the HTTP specification regarding headers with obs-fold values, review RFC 9112, Section 5.2: Obsolete Line Folding . 2025-07-28 Feature Global external Application Load Balancers now support the JA4 fingerprint . The JA4 fingerprint can be added to a custom request header using the tls_ja4_fingerprint variable. This capability is now in General Availability . 2025-07-09 Feature Application Load Balancers and Proxy Network Load Balancers now support TLS certificates with large key sizes. Previously, these load balancers supported only certificates with RSA-2048 or ECDSA P-256 key types. With this update, you can now use self-managed certificates with RSA-3072, RSA-4096, and ECDSA P-384 keys. Key details : Supported key types (for self-managed certificates): RSA-2048, RSA-3072, RSA-4096, ECDSA P-256, and ECDSA P-384 Load balancing coverage for self managed certificates: Certificate Manager SSL certificates: Global and regional load balancing Compute Engine SSL Certificates: Regional load balancing Pricing: An additional charge of $0.45 per 1 million connections applies with certificates that use RSA-3072 and RSA-4096 key types. There are no per-connection charges for certificates that use RSA-2048, ECDSA P-256, or ECDSA P-384 key types. For more information, see the documentation for Supported key types . This capability is now in General Availability . 2025-07-08 Feature Zonal affinity, configured on the backend service of an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer, lets you limit cross-zone traffic, reduce latency, and improve performance, all while maintaining the benefits of a multi-zonal architecture. Internal passthrough Network Load Balancers support three zonal affinity options that offer varying degrees of preference for routing new connections to eligible backends that are in the same zone as a supported client. For more information, see Zonal affinity for internal passthrough Network Load Balancers . This feature is in Preview . 2025-06-26 Feature In typical HTTPS communication, neither the load balancer nor the backend verify each other's identity, assuming that they are within a secure perimeter and can be trusted. However, when perimeter security needs reinforcement or communication extends beyond the perimeter, backend mTLS becomes essential. Backend mTLS ensures secure communication by requiring both the load balancer and the backend to mutually verify their identities. With backend authenticated TLS , the load balancer verifies the backend server's certificate by checking its chain of trust, thereby confirming the backend's identity. Conversely, with backend mTLS , the backend server verifies the client certificate presented by the load balancer. Together, these mechanisms enable backend mTLS, ensuring that both parties validate each other's identity. Backend mTLS complements frontend mTLS, which is already generally available (GA). For details, see the following: Backend mTLS overview Set up backend authenticated TLS Set up backend mTLS This capability is in General Availability for global external Application Load Balancers. 2025-06-13 Feature Cloud Load Balancing supports load balancing to multi-NIC instances that use Dynamic NICs . This capability is in Preview . 2025-06-03 Feature Application Load Balancers now support the use of custom metrics that let you configure your load balancer's traffic distribution behavior to be based on metrics specific to your application or infrastructure requirements, rather than Google Cloud's standard utilization or rate-based metrics. Defining custom metrics for your load balancer gives you the flexibility to route application requests to the backend instances and endpoints that are most optimal for your workload. For more information, see Custom metrics for Application Load Balancers . This capability is in General availability . Feature Cleartext HTTP/2 over TCP, also known as H2C, lets you use HTTP/2 without TLS. H2C is supported by internal and external Application Load Balancers for both of the following connections: Connections between clients and the load balancer. No special configuration is required.

When we release version 3.37, we expect the new capabilities to be as shown here. Feature Restrict email transfers You can now configure your instance to prevent users with the agent role from transferring email sessions to other agents. Agents can still assign unassigned emails to themselves, and users with the manager role can still transfer email sessions from agent to agent. Administrators: There's a new Transfer Restrictions pane at Settings > Queue > Email > Edit / View > [queue] > Transfer Restrictions > Configure . Feature Skip the connecting message playback You can now configure your instance to skip playback of the connecting message when calls are connected to agents. Administrators: The Settings > Call > Call Details pane contains a new Skip the Connecting Message playback checkbox. Feature Workforce Management terminology update We've updated the terminology in the Workforce Management interface to align with Google Cloud CCaaS terminology. For example, we've changed \"supervisor\" to \"manager\", \"employee\" to \"agent\", and \"Supervisor Portal\" to \"Manager Portal\". Feature Generative knowledge assist is available in Agent Desktop Generative knowledge assist is now available in Agent Desktop as a widget that you can drag into a desktop panel. For more information, see Create desktop panels . Feature Generative knowledge assist is available in the agent adapter Generative knowledge assist is now available in the agent adapter. Feature Web SDK version 3.37 Starting with version 3.37, web SDK releases align with portal releases and share the same version number. Web SDK version 3.37 includes the following update: we've improved the accessibily of the web SDK to be in compliance with the European Accessibility Act. Fixed The following issues were addressed in this release: Fixed an issue where a blank error message box appeared in the agent adapter when a call connected. Fixed an issue where the notification icon for a new message or event in the chat adapter didn't clear after the agent viewed the message or event. Fixed a Conversational Insights issue where conversation recordings were split into a file for the human agent segment and a file for the virtual agent segment. Now all call segments are aggregated into a single recording file, which is more useful for conversational analysis. Fixed an issue where a single call was being reported as two separate calls after the following occurred: (1) A call was escalated from a virtual agent to a queue, (2) An agent clicked Answer in the agent adapter, and (3) The end-user hung up before the countdown was complete. Fixed an issue where agents were unsure whether their action of declining a call was taking effect. Now, after an agent declines a call, the Decline button changes to Declining... , the Answer button is deactivated, and a message displays indicating that the call was declined. Fixed the message that appeared in the agent adapter when an agent left a multi-party session. Instead of saying that the session will be tranferred to the remaining agents(s), the message now says that the session will be transferred to the remaining participant(s). This is because the remaining participants might not be agents. Fixed an issue where administators were unable to monitor or barge into calls. Fixed an issue where the Decline button didn't display or didn't work correctly in the agent adapter when the following occurred: (1) An agent was in an active call, and (2) The agent received a second call on their direct number. Fixed an issue where clearing the Play Call Recording Message checkbox in Settings > Call > Call Details pane didn't work if the queue was configured for human agents and virtual agents or virtual agents only. Fixed an issue where the Transfer failed error message failed to appear in the call adapter after the following occured: a transferred call wasn't answered before the unanswered call expiration time expired. Fixed an issue where an agent on a team that was assigned to a queue wasn't able to select their desired queue to make an outbound call. We also improved the text at Settings > Call > Call Details > Queue Selection for Outbound Call to better describe the call adapter behavior. Fixed an issue where the missed chat message didn't appear after the missed chat threshold expired. Fixed an issue where end-users were unable to download chat transcripts containing special characters, emoji, or redacted content. Fixed an issue with the web SDK where configuring custom system messages with empty quotes or NULL values didn't fully suppress the messages. Fixed an issue with the web SDK where some non-English characters in downloaded chat transcripts were appearing as question marks. Fixed an issue in Hubspot where recordings of transferred calls were failing to save. Fixed an issue in Salesforce where the Call button in the call adapter wasn't working for outbound calls to a phone number that was associated with a previous record. Fixed an issue where the data in reports didn't match the data in the dashboards. Fixed an issue where virtual agent calls using Dialogflow CX failed, ending unexpectedly. Fixed two cross-site scripting vulnerabilites in the agent adapter. Fixed an issue where deltacast selected the agent with the longest time in the Available status instead of the agent with the longest time since their last customer interaction. Fixed an issue where escalations from a virtual agent to a human agent failed, and audio from the last agent response before human agent escalation was truncated. Fixed an issue where transcriptions weren't being created for IVR calls. 2025-07-08 Announcement Mobile SDK 2.13 is released Mobile SDK 2.13 includes the following updates: End-users can download chat transcripts to their devices during a session or after a session ends. For more information, see Download chat transcripts using the web SDK and mobile SDKs . The user experience with post-session virtual assistants is improved in the following ways: You can configure an opt-in banner to appear for the post-session virtual assistant experience. The user interface makes it easier for an end-user to know whether they are speaking to a human agent or a post-session virtual agent. End-users can navigate the user interface using keyboard shortcuts in conformance with the W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. You can configure your instance to let end-users skip customer satisfaction surveys. Fixed The following issues were addressed in this release: Android SDK: Fixed an issue where system messages containing an empty space were being sent, even though the message strings were set to NULL. iOS SDK: Fixed an issue where the \"Skip the human agent\" button was displayed after an end-user was transferred to a virtual agent. Fixed an issue where a notification sound played for new chat messages despite the end-user disabling notifications. 2025-07-07 Announcement Session metadata in Conversational Insights conversations is GA The Google Cloud CCaaS capability of including session metadata when creating conversations in Conversational Insights is now generally available (GA) .

On June 15th, 2025 , Salesforce is rolling out an automatic upgrade to its International Components for Unicode (ICU) locale data. This affects how date, time, number, and currency formatting are handled across Apex, Visualforce, and Lightning components. This change affects Salesforce integrations that are using Apex API versions earlier than 45.0. These integrations use the legacy Java locale behavior, which could cause formatting discrepancies, incorrect parsing, or runtime errors. Solution Google has reviewed the CCaaS managed package and has updated the impacted classes to use safe, ICU-compatible parsing and formatting methods. This includes cleaning up legacy code that uses older API versions, which might affect this transition. The following table shows the affected classes: Affected classes Name API version UJETUtilsController 35.0 UJETUtilsControllerTests 35.0 UJETJWT 43.0 UJETJWTTests 43.0 UJETPageController 43.0 Required action To ensure compatibility with the Salesforce ICU update and prevent any operational impact, you must complete the following action before June 15th, 2025 : Install the v1.40 update . This installation updates the affected classes. No further action is required. What happens if you don't upgrade? If any part of your integration or Apex code uses versions earlier than 45.0 after June 15th, Salesforce will not apply the ICU formatting to those sections. This could potentially lead to issues, including the following: Incorrect date and time parsing Unexpected errors in workflows or automations Mismatch between Lightning and Classic behavior Breakage in integrations expecting consistent locale handling Google considers the affected classes in CC_AGENT_APP v1.38 to be safe. While some of the affected classes have legacy methods that are affected by this update, they are not being actively used and will be deprecated in version 1.40. Regardless, Google still recommends installing the v1.40 update. Not upgrading can potentially impact other solutions that are installed on the environment, as described in this communication. Defer the update As described in Enable the ICU Locale Formats , you can defer the automatic rollout of this update. To defer this update, follow these steps: From the Quick Find search box in Setup , enter User Interface . On the User Interface page, deselect the Enable ICU locale formats as part of the scheduled rollout checkbox. Important : This will only be effective if completed before June 15th 2025 . 2025-06-05 Announcement Patch 3.35.15 is released This patch does the following: Fixes an issue in agent desktop. When an agent had active chat sessions with two end-users simultaneously, the chat history was missing for one of the chats. ~~Fixes an issue where bulk user upload jobs on the Bulk User Management page got stuck and didn't complete.~~ Fixes an issue in agent desktop where the chat adapter was unavailable when a chat was received. 2025-05-28 Announcement Headless web SDK 3.6.5 is released This release does the following: Fixes an issue where duplicate messages from the virtual assistant appeared in the end-user's chat pane. Fixes an issue where end-users were able to reactivate inactive chats outside of operating hours. Fixes an issue with data collection forms, where the SDK timed out during the form server's first load attempt, causing a delay in the appearance of the form in the end-user's chat pane. 2025-05-27 Announcement Version 3.35 is released All release notes published on this date are part of version 3.35. The timing of the update to your instance depends on the deployment schedule that you have chosen. For more information, see Deployment schedules . Feature QM integration now includes chat session events You can now export chat session events to an external quality management (QM) system. After you configure the endpoint of your QM system in Google Cloud CCaaS, your chat session events can be streamed to the endpoint in real time. User experience change: The QM Integration dialog at Settings > Developer Settings > Session Data Export > QM Integration has a new QM Chat Events - send chat sessions events checkbox. For more information, see QM, SIPREC, and WFM integration . Feature Remove email subject lines from interaction data We now support removing email subject lines when you delete interaction data from your instance for specified end-users. The email subjects are removed when you delete data for an end-user in the Consumer Privacy dialog at Settings > Consumer Management > Consumer Privacy . To completely remove an end-user's data, you must also delete their emails from your mail server. You must also delete chat transcripts, call recordings, and other session-related files from your CRM or external storage, depending on your configuration.

On June 15th, 2025 , Salesforce is rolling out an automatic upgrade to its International Components for Unicode (ICU) locale data. This affects how date, time, number, and currency formatting are handled across Apex, Visualforce, and Lightning components. This change affects Salesforce integrations that are using Apex API versions earlier than 45.0. These integrations use the legacy Java locale behavior, which could cause formatting discrepancies, incorrect parsing, or runtime errors. Solution Google has reviewed the CCaaS managed package and has updated the impacted classes to use safe, ICU-compatible parsing and formatting methods. This includes cleaning up legacy code that uses older API versions, which might affect this transition. The following table shows the affected classes: Affected classes Name API version UJETUtilsController 35.0 UJETUtilsControllerTests 35.0 UJETJWT 43.0 UJETJWTTests 43.0 UJETPageController 43.0 Required action To ensure compatibility with the Salesforce ICU update and prevent any operational impact, you must complete the following action before June 15th, 2025 : Install the v1.40 update . This installation updates the affected classes. No further action is required. What happens if you don't upgrade? If any part of your integration or Apex code uses versions earlier than 45.0 after June 15th, Salesforce will not apply the ICU formatting to those sections. This could potentially lead to issues, including the following: Incorrect date and time parsing Unexpected errors in workflows or automations Mismatch between Lightning and Classic behavior Breakage in integrations expecting consistent locale handling Google considers the affected classes in CC_AGENT_APP v1.38 to be safe. While some of the affected classes have legacy methods that are affected by this update, they are not being actively used and will be deprecated in version 1.40. Regardless, Google still recommends installing the v1.40 update. Not upgrading can potentially impact other solutions that are installed on the environment, as described in this communication. Defer the update As described in Enable the ICU Locale Formats , you can defer the automatic rollout of this update. To defer this update, follow these steps: From the Quick Find search box in Setup , enter User Interface . On the User Interface page, deselect the Enable ICU locale formats as part of the scheduled rollout checkbox.

Extended the search conditions for the Directory tab in the agent adapter to include search by an extension number. Fixed an issue where the \"next open hours\" message was incorrect when a chat ended after midnight. Fixed an issue where the call transcript failed to continue after an agent returned from hold. Fixed an issue where the default disposition list appeared in the agent adapter instead of the custom disposition list, which was configured to appear. Fixed an issue where a user with a manager role received a \"Not Authorized\" error when attempting to use the Operation Management and Disposition Codes pages. Fixed an issue where the failReason and afterHours fields in the session metadata file were incorrect for chats that failed because they were attempted after hours. Fixed an issue where the Assign agents button wasn't working for custom after hours deflection and automatic redirection. Fixed an issue where the client secret was not saved when configuring OAuth for a custom CRM. Fixed an issue where calling the current queue status endpoint of the Manager API intermittently returned a 404 error. Fixed an issue where the wrong disposition code list appeared for an agent after transferring a chat to an agent in a different queue. Fixed an issue where chat shortcuts were not working in the agent adapter for mobile chats. Fixed issues where agents were unable to successfully move beyond the wrap-up state to handle the next call.","title":"Fixed"},{"location":"google-cloud-managed-service-for-apache-kafka/","text":"Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka 2025-07-09 Feature General availability: Metrics for all Google Cloud Managed Service for Apache Kafka resources are now available, with some exceptions.

Announcement Control plane datastore maintenance Starting in May, 2025, Google is performing maintenance on the internal control plane datastore for all GKE clusters to improve scalability and reliability. We expect to complete these improvements across GKE by October, 2025. This maintenance is happening gradually across all GKE clusters, and will occur in your clusters only during configured maintenance windows. The maintenance process is expected to take approximately 15 minutes to complete during your cluster's maintenance window. Expected impact During the internal control plane datastore maintenance, the Kubernetes API server will be unavailable for 15 minutes , regardless of whether you use a regional cluster or a zonal cluster. During this 15-minute period, you won't be able to interact with the Kubernetes API server for your cluster. Consider the following potential disruptions to your normal workflows during the maintenance window for your cluster: Kubernetes API unavailability : you can't use the kubectl tool or any other Kubernetes API client to issue commands to the control plane, regardless of whether the cluster is regional or zonal. Attempts to deploy, modify, or query resources by using the Kubernetes API will fail during this period. Halted deployments: automated deployment pipelines (CI/CD) that interact with the Kubernetes API will fail to complete tasks such as deploying or updating applications in the cluster. Google Cloud console limitations : operations for the cluster in the Google Cloud console that communicate with the Kubernetes API might fail during the maintenance period. Delayed control plane automation : features that are managed by the control plane, such as the cluster autoscaler, Horizontal or Vertical Pod Autoscaling adjustments, or some node auto-repair operations might be paused until the API server is online. The following resources have no expected impact during the maintenance period: Running applications : any running applications and services on your nodes should continue to function without interruptions. Node pool operations : existing nodes should remain connected and operational. Network traffic : traffic in the data plane, such as traffic to and from your running workloads, shouldn't be affected. What you need to do No action is required from you for the maintenance to occur. To plan for this maintenance, we recommend that you do the following: Review maintenance windows : review your cluster's maintenance window and exclusions settings and schedule maintenance windows during periods that minimize disruptions to your normal workflows. Plan for Kubernetes API unavailability : if you run critical operations in your cluster that require access to the Kubernetes API, avoid scheduling these operations during maintenance windows. ### Fixed Important: This note is incorrect. For the correct note, see the entry for August 5, 2025 . A fix is available for an issue in which the Compute Engine Persistent Disk CSI driver failed with an invalid cpuString error on GKE nodes that used custom machine types. This issue prevented successful attachment and mounting of Persistent Disk volumes on affected nodes. The fix is available in the following GKE versions: 1.31.10-gke.1021000 and later 1.32.4-gke.1698000 and later 1.33.1-gke.1386000 and later SAP on Google Cloud Announcement New SAP NetWeaver certification: C4D bare metal machine types For use with SAP NetWeaver, SAP has certified the following Compute Engine bare metal machine types: c4d-standard-384-metal and c4d-highmem-384-metal .

Security Command Center ----------------------- ### Changed [Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM)](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/ciem-overview) has launched support for log ingestion from Microsoft Azure management groups. This capability lets users set up log ingestion and then consume findings at an Azure management group level, rather than at the subscription level. For more information, see [Configure Microsoft Azure log ingestion for management groups](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/connect-secops-azure#mgmt-group). This capability is available in [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). ### Changed A new risk scoring algorithm is launched. As a result, you might see slight changes in [attack exposure scores for resources and findings](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/attack-exposure-learn). The new algorithm better reflects attacker behavior and gives a fairer representation of the relative risk level of your organization. We will monitor the results of this change and might perform further adjustments, if necessary. 2025-07-22 Announcement Google Distributed Cloud for bare metal 1.31.700-gke.72 is now available for download .

Requests are already incorporated into GKE DNS-based control plane public endpoints where hostnames end with us-central1.gke.goog . For all other GKE DNS-based control plane public endpoints, this will roll out between August 18, 2025 and August 22, 2025. Until mTLS and client certificate configuration options are available, the following details apply: A client certificate request in a TLS handshake doesn't mean that kubectl (or other compatible clients) must provide a client certificate. Client certificates are neither mandatory nor configurable. TLS libraries in current operating systems send a \"no client certificate\" response to the public endpoint's client certificate request. GKE DNS-based control plane public endpoints will not enforce client certificates or mTLS requirements until a future announcement about configuration options. If you use an intermediate proxy between kubectl (or other compatible clients) and a GKE DNS-based control plane public endpoint, ensure that it fully adheres to Section 7.4.4 of RFC 5246 , Section 4.4.2 of RFC 8446 , or Section 4.4.2.4 of RFC 8446 .

We expect to complete these improvements across GKE by October, 2025. This maintenance is happening gradually across all GKE clusters, and will occur in your clusters only during configured maintenance windows. The maintenance process is expected to take approximately 15 minutes to complete during your cluster's maintenance window. Expected impact During the internal control plane datastore maintenance, the Kubernetes API server will be unavailable for 15 minutes , regardless of whether you use a regional cluster or a zonal cluster. During this 15-minute period, you won't be able to interact with the Kubernetes API server for your cluster. Consider the following potential disruptions to your normal workflows during the maintenance window for your cluster: Kubernetes API unavailability : you can't use the kubectl tool or any other Kubernetes API client to issue commands to the control plane, regardless of whether the cluster is regional or zonal. Attempts to deploy, modify, or query resources by using the Kubernetes API will fail during this period. Halted deployments: automated deployment pipelines (CI/CD) that interact with the Kubernetes API will fail to complete tasks such as deploying or updating applications in the cluster. Google Cloud console limitations : operations for the cluster in the Google Cloud console that communicate with the Kubernetes API might fail during the maintenance period. Delayed control plane automation : features that are managed by the control plane, such as the cluster autoscaler, Horizontal or Vertical Pod Autoscaling adjustments, or some node auto-repair operations might be paused until the API server is online. The following resources have no expected impact during the maintenance period: Running applications : any running applications and services on your nodes should continue to function without interruptions. Node pool operations : existing nodes should remain connected and operational. Network traffic : traffic in the data plane, such as traffic to and from your running workloads, shouldn't be affected. What you need to do No action is required from you for the maintenance to occur. To plan for this maintenance, we recommend that you do the following: Review maintenance windows : review your cluster's maintenance window and exclusions settings and schedule maintenance windows during periods that minimize disruptions to your normal workflows. Plan for Kubernetes API unavailability : if you run critical operations in your cluster that require access to the Kubernetes API, avoid scheduling these operations during maintenance windows. ### Fixed Important: This note is incorrect. For the correct note, see the entry for August 5, 2025 .

Security Command Center ----------------------- ### Changed [Cloud Infrastructure Entitlement Management (CIEM)](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/ciem-overview) has launched support for log ingestion from Microsoft Azure management groups. This capability lets users set up log ingestion and then consume findings at an Azure management group level, rather than at the subscription level. For more information, see [Configure Microsoft Azure log ingestion for management groups](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/connect-secops-azure#mgmt-group). This capability is available in [Preview](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages). ### Changed A new risk scoring algorithm is launched. As a result, you might see slight changes in [attack exposure scores for resources and findings](https://cloud.google.com/security-command-center/docs/attack-exposure-learn). The new algorithm better reflects attacker behavior and gives a fairer representation of the relative risk level of your organization. We will monitor the results of this change and might perform further adjustments, if necessary.","title":"(2025-R31) Version updates"},{"location":"google-kubernetes-engine/#2025-07-22","text":"","title":"2025-07-22"},{"location":"google-kubernetes-engine/#announcement_2","text":"Google Distributed Cloud for bare metal 1.31.700-gke.72 is now available for download .

Feature The Oracle JDBC driver has been updated to version 19.25. Feature For faster response time for queries in BigQuery, Looker will execute BigQuery queries by using jobCreationMode=JOB_CREATION_OPTIONAL . If BigQuery can return immediate results, it will run the query without creating a job, so the record in the Looker query history will have a BigQuery query ID instead of a BigQuery job ID. See the Understanding query performance metrics documentation page for more information about the BigQuery BI Engine metrics. Feature The Query Concurrency System Activity Explore is now available. This Explore can help you identify periods of high load and investigate performance bottlenecks that are related to database connection limits.

While the 2.0.0 API is backwards-compatible with Embed SDK 1.8.x, the underlying implementation has changed for some functionality. SDK 1.8.x exported a number of classes. SDK 2.0.0 replaces these classes with interfaces that are marked as deprecated (alternative interfaces are identified). We recommend that applications use the interfaces that have an 'I' prefix (the interfaces that have prefixes are identical to the interfaces that don't have them). Applications that are upgraded to SDK 2.0.0 should continue to work and behave as they did previously. To take advantage of the API improvements, some refactoring will be required. The following major changes are included in Embed SDK 2.0.0: Navigating between dashboards, Explores, and Looks no longer requires that an iframe be recreated. Instead, the loadDashboard , loadLook , loadExplore , and loadUrl methods can be used to navigate within the Looker iframe. connect now returns a unified connection rather than a connection that is related only to a dashboard, a Look, or an Explore. The unified connection allows embedding applications to detect a user navigating inside the iframe. Support for additional Looker embedded content has been added for Looker reports and query visualizations. Note: This item was added on June 13, 2025. Feature For period-over-period (PoP) measures, a new subparameter, value_to_date , is available. When a PoP measure is defined with value_to_date:yes , Looker will calculate the amount of time in the current timeframe at the time that the query is run and apply that amount of time when it calculates the values for previous periods. Feature The Firebolt JDBC driver has been updated to version 3.5.0. Feature The Hive JDBC driver has been updated to version 4.0.1. Feature The MS SQL JDBC driver has been updated to version 12.10.0. Feature The Teradata JDBC driver has been updated to version 20.00.00.45. Feature The Vertica JDBC driver has been updated to version 24.2.0-1. Feature The new Content Guardrails admin panel lets Looker admins limit both the ability for users to add or execute merged results queries on dashboards and the use of the dashboard auto-refresh option. Limiting merged results queries and dashboard auto-refreshes can reduce the number of queries that are sent to the database and improve dashboard performance. Note: This item was added on June 12, 2025. Feature The Looker Continuous Integration (CI) features let you run tests on your LookML project to deliver more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly data experiences. You can use the CI validators to catch issues with SQL, data test, content, and LookML before they hit production to verify your LookML and prevent query errors for your users. You can also configure the CI validators to run automatically when a pull request is submitted to your LookML repository. Note: This item was added on June 23, 2025. Fixed This release contains the following accessibility improvements: Increased contrast ratio for graphic elements, including icon bullets Improved contrast for download links and unemphasized text to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Level AA Fixed The Tile Actions kebab menu now includes the name of the dashboard tile in its aria-label value. Fixed An issue has been fixed where SDK API calls could return a 500 error if optional headers were not specified. The API calls now work as expected even if optional headers are not included. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the PDT Override Service Account field was not available for connections that use OAuth credentials. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the Manage Access dialog on a folder could load slowly if the Looker instance has a large number of groups. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where, previously, testing a new OAuth connection before saving would run connection tests on an empty connection. OAuth settings must now be saved before running connection tests. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed The OAuth Tenant ID field will no longer appear in connections for which it is not relevant. The only connection type that supports this field is Trino. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the API calls to run git connection tests would fail unless the user was in dev mode. These calls now work as expected whether the user is in production or development mode. Fixed An issue has been fixed where drill downs wouldn't be displayed for a field if the first field value had null values. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where assigning the user attribute looker_internal_email_domain_allowlist on the SAML config page would return a 500 error. This user attribute is not designed to be assigned at the user level, so the option to assign it has been removed from the SAML config page. Fixed An issue has been fixed where restarting the Looker instance during a folder sync could cause the instance to fail to start. Fixed An issue has been fixed where selecting fields from the Session view in the System Activity User Explore could cause fanout. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the count table calculation function could return incorrect values if its inputs included a list with null values. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the drill menu did not properly translate some entries when the locale was set to Swedish (sv_SE). This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where drilling on a query with subtotals could display incorrect values. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where filtering on a custom dimension that references a datetime type field could return the following error message: No matching signature . This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the LookML validator would return a 500 error if a LookML file contained a sum_distinct measure for a database that doesn't support sum_distinct measures. The LookML validator now returns a more descriptive error message. Fixed An issue has been fixed where entering the value 12:00 in the Time field of an alert schedule dialog would input 00:00 instead. Fixed An issue has been fixed where changes to PDT override settings would not be saved. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where PDTs could fail to rebuild with the following error message: undefined method trace_id_hex . This feature now performs as expected. Feature You can now embed Looker reports on Looker (original) instances when Looker reports and the Embed Looker reports Labs features are enabled for your instance. Looker reports are available in preview. Fixed An issue has been fixed where LDAP authentication could fail with the following error message: no implicit conversion of Hash into String . This feature now performs as expected. Feature The Code Interpreter in Conversational Analytics is now available in Preview . The Code Interpreter translates your natural language questions into Python code and executes that code to provide advanced analysis and visualizations. The Code Interpreter is disabled by default. Admins of Looker (Google Cloud core) instances can manage enablement for the Code Interpreter on the Gemini in Looker admin page . Note: This item was added on June 23, 2025. 2025-06-09 Announcement Gemini in Looker will be enabled by default for Looker (original) instances that meet at least one of the following criteria: The Automated Gemini in Looker enablement and user management setting on the Settings page in the Looker Admin panel was previously enabled.

While the 2.0.0 API is backwards-compatible with Embed SDK 1.8.x, the underlying implementation has changed for some functionality. SDK 1.8.x exported a number of classes. SDK 2.0.0 replaces these classes with interfaces that are marked as deprecated (alternative interfaces are identified). We recommend that applications use the interfaces that have an 'I' prefix (the interfaces that have prefixes are identical to the interfaces that don't have them). Applications that are upgraded to SDK 2.0.0 should continue to work and behave as they did previously. To take advantage of the API improvements, some refactoring will be required. The following major changes are included in Embed SDK 2.0.0: Navigating between dashboards, Explores, and Looks no longer requires that an iframe be recreated. Instead, the loadDashboard , loadLook , loadExplore , and loadUrl methods can be used to navigate within the Looker iframe. connect now returns a unified connection rather than a connection that is related only to a dashboard, a Look, or an Explore. The unified connection allows embedding applications to detect a user navigating inside the iframe.
