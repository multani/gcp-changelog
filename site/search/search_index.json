The A4X machine series has the NVIDIA GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchips attached and runs on the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 platform. Use this machine type to run your large artificial intelligence (AI) models and machine learning (ML) workloads. The A4X machine type is currently available in the us-central1-a zone. Feature Generally available : You can receive a notification when maintenance for an A4X reservation sub-block is scheduled, starts, or is completed. Additionally, you can now view and trigger maintenance for an A4X reservation sub-block. These features give you more control over maintenance for your A4X reservations, helping you minimize downtimes for your workloads. For more information, see Manage host events across reservations . Feature You can receive at least seven days of advance notice for unplanned hardware maintenance for a reservation. This feature helps you more proactively control disruptions to your workloads when unplanned maintenance is scheduled after a host error or faulty host report. For more information, see Manage hardware emergency maintenance notifications . Feature Generally available : You can use the following Cloud Monitoring metrics to monitor your A4X VMs, and help you identify and troubleshoot issues with your GPUs: NVLink runtime error Uncorrectable DRAM ECC errors Uncorrectable DRAM row remapping count Uncorrectable DRAM row remapping failed Uncorrectable PCIe errors Uncorrectable cache ECC errors For more information, see Monitor VMs and Slurm clusters . Feature Generally available : You can view and manage the topology of your A4X reservations, including sub-blocks. This feature helps you better understand the topology of the VMs in your workload to further minimize network latency, as well as understand the health of your reservation blocks or sub-blocks. For more information, see View reserved capacity . Feature Generally available : When you reserve capacity for creating VMs, you can specify the reservation operational mode for your reserved capacity. A reservation operational mode defines how your VMs behave after a host error or faulty host report, and it determines your level of visibility and control over the reservation's infrastructure. For more information, see Reservation operational mode . Feature Generally available : When you reserve capacity for creating VMs, you can specify a maintenance scheduling type for your reservations. This feature helps you minimize downtimes by letting you specify whether you want to group VMs and have synchronized maintenance scheduling ( grouped ), or loosely couple VMs have independent maintenance scheduling ( independent ). For more information, see Maintenance scheduling types . 2025-07-18 Feature Generally available : You can troubleshoot workloads with slow performance by using straggler detection metrics and logs. Stragglers are single-point, non-crashing failures that eventually slow down your entire workload. Large-scale ML workloads are very susceptible to stragglers, and VMs with stragglers are often very difficult to notice and pinpoint without straggler detection. For more information, see Monitor VMs and Slurm clusters and Troubleshoot slow performance . 2025-07-10 Feature Generally available : You can now manage the Collective Communication Analyzer (CoMMA) , a library that uses the NVIDIA Collective Communication Library (NCCL) profiler plugin to collect detailed NCCL telemetry for GPU machine types. The collected performance metrics and operational events are used for analyzing and optimizing large-scale AI and ML training workloads. CoMMA is automatically installed and enabled on A4X, A4 High, and A3 Ultra machine types when using specific images. You can manage this data collection by disabling the plugin, adjusting its data granularity levels, or manually installing it on other GPU machine types. For more information, see Enable, disable, and configure CoMMA . 2025-07-07 Feature Preview : You can use future reservations in calendar mode to obtain resources for up to 90 days. By creating a request in calendar mode, you can reserve up to 80 GPU VMs for a future date and time. Then, you can use that capacity to run the following workloads: Model pre-training Model fine-tuning Simulations Inference For more information, see Choose a consumption option . 2025-06-11 Feature Generally available : You can apply a workload policy in a managed instance group (MIG) to specify the type of the workload to run on the MIG. Workload policies help improve the workload performance by optimizing the underlying infrastructure. The supported type, high-throughput , is ideal for workloads that require high networking performance.

Feature New model for Abuse Detection's Advanced Anomaly Detection rule With this release, we introduced a new and improved machine learning model for anomaly detection in Advanced API Security. This new model includes the following improvements: Trained on customer-specific traffic patterns. The new model is trained exclusively on your organization's historical API traffic data. It continues to learn from your API traffic patterns over time to increase accuracy. Engineered by Google for anomaly detection. The new model is a custom Vertex AI-based machine learning model, engineered and also used internally by Google specifically to detect anomalies in traffic patterns. Usage requirements: In order to use this new model, you must explicitly opt in to allow the model to use your traffic and other data to train for anomaly detection. Note that your data is never shared with other customers for training purposes. The new model is not available for VPC-SC customers at this time. The new anomaly detection model replaces the old model, with no customer-facing changes to the API or UI. Upon opting in for model training, you can expect to start seeing detected anomalies within 6 hours. If you have already opted in to allow the older version of our anomaly detection model to use your traffic data for training, you will not need to opt in again. For more information on this model and on Abuse Detection, see Abuse Detection customer documentation , including Detection rules . 2025-05-27 Announcement On May 27, 2025 we released an updated version of Apigee Advanced API Security.

It leverages Apigee shadow API discovery and uses automated discovery processes to bring all your APIs, across Google Cloud projects , into a unified, managed view. For more information, see API observations in API hub . Note: Rollouts of this feature will begin today, and may take five or more business days to be completed across all Google Cloud zones. You may not be able to view or use API observations until the rollout is complete. 2025-07-31 Feature New data source support for plugins API hub now supports importing API metadata through new dedicated plugins for the following data sources: Apigee Edge Public Cloud Apigee Edge Private Cloud (OPDK) For more information, see Plugins overview . Feature Push-based plugin ingestion API hub now supports push-based plugin ingestion. This method allows for more real-time synchronization of API metadata. All new Apigee, Apigee hybrid, Apigee Edge Public Cloud, and Apigee Edge Private Cloud (OPDK) plugins are created with push-based ingestion by default. For more information, see Plugin data ingestion methods . Note: Rollouts of this feature will begin today, and may take five or more business days to be completed across all Google Cloud zones. You may not be able to create push-based plugins until the rollout is complete. Feature Create custom plugins [API only] You can now use the Create Plugin API to create custom plugins in API hub. Custom plugins are created manually to connect API hub to a specific API data source. For more information, see Create custom plugins . Issue Default Apigee plugin instance not auto-created during runtime attachment Issue: When provisioning API hub as part of Apigee provisioning, the default Apigee X and hybrid plugin instance is not automatically created. This prevents API proxies from being auto-registered. Workaround: You can manually attach an Apigee runtime instance and import the Apigee assets. See Attach a runtime project . Changed Delete plugin instance changes API hub no longer retains any ingested metadata from a plugin after its deletion. Deleting a plugin instance also permanently deletes all the associated API data from API hub. For more information, see Delete a plugin instance . Changed Provisioning changes and Apigee API proxy registration API hub changed how it registers API proxies from Apigee and how it creates default plugin instances during provisioning. API hub now automatically creates a default Apigee X and hybrid plugin instance and auto-registers API proxies only when you provision it as part of Apigee provisioning. If you provision API hub directly from the API hub UI, API hub does not automatically create a default plugin instance, nor does it auto-register proxies. For more information, see Project attachments and plugins . Changed New tutorial: Enrich API data in API hub A new tutorial is available for enriching API data in Apigee API hub. It shows you how to use API hub's custom curation features to automatically fetch OpenAPI specifications from a Cloud Storage bucket and associate them with their corresponding Apigee API proxies. The custom curation logic is defined using an integration in Application Integration. For more information, see Enrich API data with custom curation in API hub . Deprecated Deprecation of pull-based ingestion for Apigee plugins Pull-based ingestion is no longer supported for Apigee and Apigee hybrid plugins as of July 31, 2025 . For existing projects that have pull-based Apigee X and hybrid plugins configured, these plugins will continue to function and will be automatically migrated to the push-based type starting August 2025 . Deprecated Deprecation of Apigee proxy deployment attributes As of July 31st, 2025 , the Apigee X and Hybrid Environment and Apigee X and Hybrid Organization attributes will no longer be added to new Apigee proxy deployments. This change specifically applies when you import deployments into API hub by attaching a runtime project. If your existing projects use these attributes in filtered search queries, we recommend updating them. To ensure your searches continue to work, use the Source project and Source environment fields as alternatives. 2025-07-22 Changed API hub provisioning now enables Apigee API When you provision API hub, it now enables the Apigee API ( apigee.googleapis.com ) in your Google Cloud project. If Apigee isn't already provisioned, an Apigee organization is also automatically created in your project as part of the provisioning process. API hub remains a free service. Enabling the Apigee API has no additional pricing or billing implications for your project. For more information, see Provision API hub in the Cloud console . Changed API hub deprovisioning changes Deprovisioning an API hub instance now also deletes any associated Apigee organizations from your Google Cloud project, provided those Apigee organizations have no Apigee instances. If you deprovision an API hub instance, you can reprovision it later, but you'll need to wait 7 days before you can do so. For more information, see Deprovision Apigee API hub . Changed VPC Service Controls (VPC-SC) is GA VPC Service Controls in API hub is now GA . For more information, see VPC Service Controls for API hub . 2025-07-18 Feature Apigee and hybrid plugin instance management You can now create and delete plugin instances for Apigee and Apigee Hybrid while associating the respective Apigee runtime projects to API hub. For more information, see Auto-register Apigee proxies . Breaking Apigee and Apigee hybrid plugin creation now requires source project ID When creating new instances of the Apigee X and hybrid plugin, you must now provide a source project ID. This source project ID is the Google Cloud project from which the plugin will import data. This is a breaking change and will affect any existing API calls that create these plugins without explicitly providing this ID. Action Required: Update your API calls to include the appropriate source project ID when creating new Apigee X and hybrid plugins. Failing to do so will result in creation errors. Changed Edit plugin instances changes You can now change or modify the name and curation logic of your plugin instance. For more information, see Edit a plugin instance . Changed Resource URI format for Apigee deployments To ensure optimal functionality and consistency while creating or updating Apigee deployments, we now recommend that the Resource URI conforms to the following format: organizations/([^/]+)/environments/([^/]+)/apis/([^/]+)$ For more information, see Introduction to deployments . 2025-06-03 Announcement On June 3, 2025, we released an updated version of Apigee. Feature Apigee API hub is enabled for new Apigee organizations in supported regions. With this release, we are enabling Apigee API hub for new Apigee organizations in regions where API hub is supported . All new Apigee organizations, including hybrid organizations, that select an API hub-supported region for their Apigee Analytics region during provisioning will have access to API hub features at no additional cost. API hub allows you to view, organize, and manage all of the APIs in your Apigee organization in one central location. To learn more, see What is Apigee API hub? No action on your part is required to provision API hub for your organization, with the following exceptions: If your Apigee organization has Data Residency or VPC Service Controls enabled, you must configure your API hub instance manually to support these services. See VPC Service Controls for API hub and API hub and data residency for more information. If your Apigee organization uses Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK), you must deprovision the Apigee API hub instance provided by default and recreate it to support CMEK.

Feature Apigee policies for LLM/GenAI workloads Apigee hybrid now supports the following Apigee policies with support for LLM/GenAI workloads. SemanticCacheLookup policy SemanticCachePopulate policy SanitizeUserPrompt SanitizeModelResponse The Apigee semantic caching policies enable intelligent response reuse based on semantic similarity. Using these policies in your Apigee API proxies can minimize redundant backend API calls, reduce latency, and lower operational costs. With this release, the semantic caching policies support URL templating, enabling the use of variables for AI model endpoint values. The Model Armor policies protect your AI applications by sanitizing user prompts to and responses from large language models (LLMs). Using these policies in your Apigee API proxies can mitigate the risks associated with LLM usage by leveraging Model Armor to detect prompt injection, prevent jailbreak attacks, apply responsible AI filters, filter malicious URLs, and protect sensitive data. Note: In Apigee hybrid, this feature has the following limitations: Support for these policies is limited to installations on Google Cloud Platform.

Using these policies in your Apigee API proxies can minimize redundant backend API calls, reduce latency, and lower operational costs. With this release, the semantic caching policies support URL templating, enabling the use of variables for AI model endpoint values. The Model Armor policies protect your AI applications by sanitizing user prompts to and responses from large language models (LLMs). Using these policies in your Apigee API proxies can mitigate the risks associated with LLM usage by leveraging Model Armor to detect prompt injection, prevent jailbreak attacks, apply responsible AI filters, filter malicious URLs, and protect sensitive data. Note: In Apigee hybrid, this feature has the following limitations: Support for these policies is limited to installations on Google Cloud Platform.

Changed Bug ID Description N/A Updates to security infrastructure and libraries. 2025-09-04 Announcement On September 4, 2025, we released an updated version of Apigee. Feature Apigee policies for LLM/GenAI workloads are Generally Available (GA) Four new Apigee policies supporting LLM/GenAI workloads are now GA : SemanticCacheLookup policy SemanticCachePopulate policy SanitizeUserPrompt SanitizeModelResponse The Apigee semantic caching policies enable intelligent response reuse based on semantic similarity. Using these policies in your Apigee API proxies can minimize redundant backend API calls, reduce latency, and lower operational costs. With this release, the semantic caching policies support URL templating, enabling the use of variables for AI model endpoint values. The Model Armor policies protect your AI applications by sanitizing user prompts to and responses from large language models (LLMs). Using these policies in your Apigee API proxies can mitigate the risks associated with LLM usage by leveraging Model Armor to detect prompt injection, prevent jailbreak attacks, apply responsible AI filters, filter malicious URLs, and protect sensitive data. For more information on using these policies in your Apigee API proxies, see: Get started with semantic caching policies Get started with Apigee Model Armor policies 2025-09-03 Announcement On September 3, 2025, we released an updated version of Apigee.

Using these policies in your Apigee API proxies can minimize redundant backend API calls, reduce latency, and lower operational costs. With this release, the semantic caching policies support URL templating, enabling the use of variables for AI model endpoint values. The Model Armor policies protect your AI applications by sanitizing user prompts to and responses from large language models (LLMs). Using these policies in your Apigee API proxies can mitigate the risks associated with LLM usage by leveraging Model Armor to detect prompt injection, prevent jailbreak attacks, apply responsible AI filters, filter malicious URLs, and protect sensitive data.

When you click Data export on the Cloud Carbon console Ul for a given billing account, you can now see Carbon Footprint exports that you have access to for that billing account, in addition to the ability to create a new data export. This feature helps you better manage your Carbon Footprint exports in BigQuery. Read more for details. In some cases, the list of exports may not be complete for the following reasons: Permissions : The export was configured in a project that you don't have permission to view. Performance Optimization : To optimize performance and prevent latency when you have access to a very large number of projects, the search may not display exports in all projects. 2025-09-12 Fixed We have corrected an issue affecting the market-based Scope 2 emissions for the europe-west2 (London) region in the July 2025 Carbon Footprint data. In the July 2025 methodology update , renewable energy coverage was misapplied to the Scope 2 market-based emissions in the europe-west2 (London) region. This resulted in non-zero Scope 2 market-based emissions for europe-west2. This inconsistency arose from evolving RE100 market-boundary guidance following Brexit. While RE100 guidance excludes the UK from the EU market-boundary post-Brexit, it allows for the use of previously purchased EU energy attribute certificates (EACs) with sufficiently close vintages to be applied against UK consumption in 2024. Google's application of these EACs to UK consumption results in zero Scope 2 market-based emissions in the europe-west2 (London). We have corrected our data to align with the RE100 market boundaries guidance and our corporate environmental reporting of matched renewable energy. Scope 2 market-based emissions for europe-west2 are now correctly reported as zero for July 2025, using 2024 renewable energy coverage consistent with Google's environmental report. To correct your historical data, please run a backfill for July 2025 in your carbon footprint export. Due to a half-month lag in our data release, you will need to backfill the data for August 15, 2025, which will then update the July 2025 data in your BigQuery table. Data for August 2025, available on September 15, 2025, will automatically reflect this correction. Data for all previous periods remains unaffected. 2025-09-03 Announcement We recently released a new technical paper, \"Measuring the Environmental Impact of Delivering AI at Google Scale\" and blogpost . This research establishes a more comprehensive methodology for measuring the energy, emissions, and water consumption of AI inference in a live production environment. Our goal is to promote greater transparency and encourage the industry to align on more standardized, comprehensive measurement frameworks. Currently, the data in Google Cloud Carbon Footprint for AI services does not fully reflect this comprehensive approach, which we believe is the most transparent environmental impact assessment from AI labs today. To better align with this new, more detailed methodology, we will be updating our carbon accounting pipeline for services that use AI, such as Vertex AI. The new methodology provides a more accurate and complete picture of the environmental impact of AI services. We anticipate that this change, which will be implemented during our next semi-annual methodology refresh, may result in an increase in the emissions data for some of our Cloud AI services. However, we believe this move to more actionable data will enable us to more readily incentivize and track optimizations for these AI services. The updated data will be released with the January 2026 methodology refresh, which is expected to be available in mid-February 2026. We believe this is an important step toward providing you with the most accurate and actionable data possible to manage your cloud usage more sustainably. 2025-08-14 Changed For the July 2025 semi-annual methodology refresh (released in mid-August 2025), we implemented the following improvements and updated the carbon model to version 14: Updating Scope 1 & 3 emissions from Google's corporate footprint : Updated Scope 1 & 3 allocation factors using latest Google company-wide data from 2025 Google Environmental Report . See the non-electricity emission sources section of methodology documentation on how we apply these Scope 1 & 3 emissions across Google products and services. Updating inputs for Scope 2 market-based emissions calculation from Google's corporate footprint : Updated annual renewable electricity percentage from Google's clean energy procurement, in accordance with 2025 Google Environmental Report , as an input for Scope 2 market-based emissions. Updated annual emissions factors from latest government sources, in accordance with 2025 Google Environmental Report , as an input for Scope 2 market-based emissions. Note that Scope 2 location-based emissions are estimated using hourly greenhouse gas emissions factors. Read more about the difference in methodology between Scope 2 location-based and market-based emissions in the methodology document . Improving data accuracy : A data issue impacting Cloud Run emissions calculations for March 2025 has been resolved. Incorrect carbon footprint data were generated for some Cloud Run SKUs due to a bug in our data processing logic, resulting in inflated carbon emission figures for affected users. To correct your historical data, please run a backfill for March 2025 in your carbon footprint export. Due to a half-month lag in our data release, you will need to backfill the data for April 15, 2025, which will then update the March 2025 data in your BigQuery table. Data for all other periods remains unaffected. Updating service coverage : Integration Connectors and Application Integration were removed from covered services of Carbon Footprint, due to potential mis-attribution of carbon to these services. We are actively investigating and working on the improvements. Once internal data mapping improves for a service, we plan to add it back. Deprecating carbon offsets fields from schema : The carbon_offsets_kgCO2e and carbon_footprint_total_kgCO2e.after_offsets fields have been deprecated in the Carbon Footprint schema due to Google's strategic shift from traditional carbon offsets to a direct focus on carbon removal technologies and projects. If you have already set up an export , these two fields have been set to NULL and will not be updated. This change is in line with Google's evolving strategy for achieving its net-zero climate goals with more robust and impactful climate solutions such as carbon removal technologies.

In the July 2025 methodology update , renewable energy coverage was misapplied to the Scope 2 market-based emissions in the europe-west2 (London) region. This resulted in non-zero Scope 2 market-based emissions for europe-west2. This inconsistency arose from evolving RE100 market-boundary guidance following Brexit. While RE100 guidance excludes the UK from the EU market-boundary post-Brexit, it allows for the use of previously purchased EU energy attribute certificates (EACs) with sufficiently close vintages to be applied against UK consumption in 2024. Google's application of these EACs to UK consumption results in zero Scope 2 market-based emissions in the europe-west2 (London). We have corrected our data to align with the RE100 market boundaries guidance and our corporate environmental reporting of matched renewable energy. Scope 2 market-based emissions for europe-west2 are now correctly reported as zero for July 2025, using 2024 renewable energy coverage consistent with Google's environmental report. To correct your historical data, please run a backfill for July 2025 in your carbon footprint export. Due to a half-month lag in our data release, you will need to backfill the data for August 15, 2025, which will then update the July 2025 data in your BigQuery table. Data for August 2025, available on September 15, 2025, will automatically reflect this correction.

This research establishes a more comprehensive methodology for measuring the energy, emissions, and water consumption of AI inference in a live production environment. Our goal is to promote greater transparency and encourage the industry to align on more standardized, comprehensive measurement frameworks. Currently, the data in Google Cloud Carbon Footprint for AI services does not fully reflect this comprehensive approach, which we believe is the most transparent environmental impact assessment from AI labs today. To better align with this new, more detailed methodology, we will be updating our carbon accounting pipeline for services that use AI, such as Vertex AI. The new methodology provides a more accurate and complete picture of the environmental impact of AI services. We anticipate that this change, which will be implemented during our next semi-annual methodology refresh, may result in an increase in the emissions data for some of our Cloud AI services. However, we believe this move to more actionable data will enable us to more readily incentivize and track optimizations for these AI services. The updated data will be released with the January 2026 methodology refresh, which is expected to be available in mid-February 2026. We believe this is an important step toward providing you with the most accurate and actionable data possible to manage your cloud usage more sustainably.","title":"Announcement"},{"location":"carbon-footprint/#2025-08-14","text":"","title":"2025-08-14"},{"location":"carbon-footprint/#changed","text":"For the July 2025 semi-annual methodology refresh (released in mid-August 2025), we implemented the following improvements and updated the carbon model to version 14: Updating Scope 1 & 3 emissions from Google's corporate footprint : Updated Scope 1 & 3 allocation factors using latest Google company-wide data from 2025 Google Environmental Report . See the non-electricity emission sources section of methodology documentation on how we apply these Scope 1 & 3 emissions across Google products and services. Updating inputs for Scope 2 market-based emissions calculation from Google's corporate footprint : Updated annual renewable electricity percentage from Google's clean energy procurement, in accordance with 2025 Google Environmental Report , as an input for Scope 2 market-based emissions. Updated annual emissions factors from latest government sources, in accordance with 2025 Google Environmental Report , as an input for Scope 2 market-based emissions. Note that Scope 2 location-based emissions are estimated using hourly greenhouse gas emissions factors. Read more about the difference in methodology between Scope 2 location-based and market-based emissions in the methodology document . Improving data accuracy : A data issue impacting Cloud Run emissions calculations for March 2025 has been resolved. Incorrect carbon footprint data were generated for some Cloud Run SKUs due to a bug in our data processing logic, resulting in inflated carbon emission figures for affected users. To correct your historical data, please run a backfill for March 2025 in your carbon footprint export. Due to a half-month lag in our data release, you will need to backfill the data for April 15, 2025, which will then update the March 2025 data in your BigQuery table. Data for all other periods remains unaffected. Updating service coverage : Integration Connectors and Application Integration were removed from covered services of Carbon Footprint, due to potential mis-attribution of carbon to these services. We are actively investigating and working on the improvements. Once internal data mapping improves for a service, we plan to add it back. Deprecating carbon offsets fields from schema : The carbon_offsets_kgCO2e and carbon_footprint_total_kgCO2e.after_offsets fields have been deprecated in the Carbon Footprint schema due to Google's strategic shift from traditional carbon offsets to a direct focus on carbon removal technologies and projects. If you have already set up an export , these two fields have been set to NULL and will not be updated. This change is in line with Google's evolving strategy for achieving its net-zero climate goals with more robust and impactful climate solutions such as carbon removal technologies.

Fixed (Cloud Composer 3) The DAGS_FOLDER reserved environment variable now correctly points to the local directory where DAG files are stored. Changed New Airflow builds are available in Cloud Composer 3: composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.10 (default) composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.30 Changed New images are available in Cloud Composer 2: composer-2.13.8-airflow-2.10.5 (default) composer-2.13.8-airflow-2.9.3 Deprecated Cloud Composer version 2.8.6 has reached its end of support period . 2025-07-24 Feature Web server restarting is is now generally available (GA) in Cloud Composer 2 and Cloud Composer 3. 2025-07-23 Announcement If your environment uses dag-factory package version 0.22, then you might experience DAG failures in Cloud Composer versions that have apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes package version 10.4.2 or later. At the same time, upgrading the dag-factory package to version 0.23 might require you to update your DAG code to make it compatible. If your environment uses dag-factory version 0.22, we recommend to do the following: Temporarily postpone upgrading your environment until you're ready to switch to dag-factory version 0.23. Last versions of Cloud Composer that support version 0.22 are composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.3, composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.23, composer-2.13.1-airflow-2.10.5, and composer-2.13.1-airflow-2.9.3 released on May 14, 2025. When you are ready to upgrade, update your DAGs for compatibility with 0.23. We recommend to do this in a development environment first. Install dag-factory version 0.23, then check that your DAGs are parsed and are working correctly, and update them if needed. After your DAGs are compatible, install dag-factory version 0.23 in your production environment and transfer the updated DAGs. Your environment can now be upgraded to a later version of Cloud Composer or Airflow. If your environment is already upgraded to a later version of Cloud Composer and you experience problems, then update dag-factory to version 0.23 and update your DAGs for compatibility with 0.23. 2025-07-17 Feature Highly resilient environments are now generally available (GA) in Cloud Composer 3. 2025-07-14 Changed We're changing the way we provide support dates for Airflow builds in Cloud Composer 3. Before this change, some Airflow builds had their end of support date listed as \"To be announced\" until a later Airflow version became available. We're deprecating this approach for all builds that are released after July 01, 2025. We are now providing support dates that depend on a date when a particular Airflow build was released: We are introducing the standard support period of 12 months after the release date. All Airflow builds that didn't have an end of support date when this change was introduced are supported until July 1, 2026. Because of this change, some Airflow builds released before July 1, 2025 are supported for longer than the standard support period. All Airflow builds that had their support date shorter than 12 months are now supported for 12 months since the date of their initial release. All builds released after July 1, 2025 will use the standard support period. 2025-07-09 Announcement A new Cloud Composer release has started on July 9, 2025 . Get ready for upcoming changes and features as we roll out the new release to all regions. This release is in progress at the moment. Listed changes and features might not be available in some regions yet. Changed We are gradually rolling out a change that switches the default version from Cloud Composer 2 to Cloud Composer 3 in the Cloud Composer API. In regions where the change is rolled out, a Cloud Composer 3 environment is created by default when a version is not specified in Google Cloud CLI, Cloud Composer API, or Terraform. If you use automation scripts to provision Cloud Composer 2 environments, make sure that you explicitly specify a Cloud Composer 2 version. In this release, the change is rolling out in the following regions: africa-south1, asia-northeast2, asia-south2, asia-southeast2, europe-southwest1, europe-west10, europe-west12, europe-west8, me-central1, me-central2, me-west1, southamerica-west1, and us-south1. Changed (Available without upgrading) During Cloud Composer 2 environment operations, a more informative error message is returned when an environment's web server has connectivity issues. Changed New Airflow builds are available in Cloud Composer 3: composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.9 (default) composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.29 Changed New images are available in Cloud Composer 2: composer-2.13.7-airflow-2.10.5 (default) composer-2.13.7-airflow-2.9.3 Deprecated Cloud Composer versions 2.8.4 and 2.8.5 have reached their end of support period . 2025-07-02 Changed Cloud Composer 1 and Cloud Composer 2 environments with version 2.0.x are approaching their end of life . We're planning to deprecate them in the following way: Starting September 15, 2025 , you will no longer be able to create new Cloud Composer 1 environments. On September 15, 2026 , all Cloud Composer 1 and Cloud Composer 2 version 2.0.x environments will reach their planned end of life, and you won't be able to use them . Cloud Composer 2 environments with versions later than 2.1.0 and all Cloud Composer 3 environments are not affected by this deprecation. We recommend planning migration to Cloud Composer 3 or upgrading your Cloud Composer 2 environments to a later version. 2025-07-01 Announcement A new Cloud Composer release has started on July 1, 2025 . This release is in progress at the moment. Listed changes might not be available in some regions yet. Changed This release includes internal infrastructure improvements to Cloud Composer. There are no user-visible changes. Changed New Airflow builds are available in Cloud Composer 3: composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.8 (default) composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.28 Changed New images are available in Cloud Composer 2: composer-2.13.6-airflow-2.10.5 (default) composer-2.13.6-airflow-2.9.3 2025-06-23 Feature Improved the startup times of Airflow workers for environments that have a large number of custom PyPI packages installed. This feature was announced previously and is gradually rolling out over several releases. In this release, it's available in asia-east2, asia-northeast3, europe-central2, europe-west9, me-central1, me-west1, northamerica-northeast1, northamerica-northeast2, northamerica-south1, and us-west1 re Fixed (Available without upgrading) Fixed an issue where deleting a Cloud Composer 2 environment could fail when the environment's cluster was in the process of creating a node pool. Changed (Airflow 2.10.5) The apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes package was upgraded to version 10.5.0 from version 10.4.2. For changes in other packages, see the preinstalled packages changelog . Changed New Airflow builds are available in Cloud Composer 3: composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.7 (default) composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.27 Changed New images are available in Cloud Composer 2: composer-2.13.5-airflow-2.10.5 (default) composer-2.13.5-airflow-2.9.3 Deprecated Cloud Composer version 2.8.3 has reached its end of support period . 2025-06-16 Announcement We're planning to phase out the APIs that aren't required by Cloud Composer 3. Starting February 27, 2026 , the following APIs will become fully detachable . Deactivating these APIs won't cause the deactivation of the Cloud Composer API: artifactregistry.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com sqladmin.googleapis.com Starting May 27, 2026 , these APIs will no longer be enabled automatically when you enable the Cloud Composer API. To create Cloud Composer 2 environments in new projects, the group of detached APIs must be enabled manually. Existing Cloud Composer 3 and Cloud Composer 2 environments in projects where the Cloud Composer API is already enabled will not be impacted. You can do the following: After February 27, 2026 , if your project has only Cloud Composer 3 environments, then you can manually disable the detached APIs. After February 27, 2026 , if your project has Cloud Composer 2 environments, then we recommend keeping these APIs enabled because disabling them might lead to environment's malfunction. After May 27, 2026 , if you use automation scripts to provision Cloud Composer 2 environments, then make sure that the listed APIs are enabled in addition to the Cloud Composer API. 2025-06-13 Feature Cloud Composer pages in the Cloud Console now support the dark color theme. You can switch to the dark theme on the Appearance page in the Cloud Console. 2025-06-10 Announcement A new Cloud Composer release has started on June 10, 2025 . Get ready for upcoming changes and features as we roll out the new release to all regions. This release is in progress at the moment. Listed changes and features might not be available in some regions yet. Fixed Fixed an issue that caused Airflow worker and scheduler Pods to be evicted when a large number of tasks was executed. Changed New Airflow builds are available in Cloud Composer 3: composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.6 (default) composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.26 Changed New images are available in Cloud Composer 2: composer-2.13.4-airflow-2.10.5 (default) composer-2.13.4-airflow-2.9.3 Deprecated Cloud Composer version 2.8.2 has reached its end of support period . 2025-06-02 Feature Improved the startup times of Airflow workers for environments that have a large number of custom PyPI packages installed. This change rolls out gradually. In this release, it's available in asia-east1, asia-northeast2, asia-south1, europe-north1, europe-west3, us-east1, us-south1, and us-west2 regions. Changed (Cloud Composer 3) If a VPC network is attached to an environment, then all DNS addresses accessed by the Airflow components of the environment are resolved using the Cloud DNS configuration of the VPC network. In particular, Airflow workers that execute DAGs will resolve DNS addresses in this way. Changed (Cloud Composer 3) All newly created private DNS zones are immediately visible to a Cloud Composer environment. Previously, re-attaching a VPC network was required. Fixed (Cloud Composer 3) It's now possible to use zones with cross-project binding . Before this change, cross-project bound zones weren't supported in Cloud Composer 3. Changed (Cloud Composer 2) In Cloud Composer versions 2.11.5 and later, log processing is switching to using OpenTelemetry instead of Fluentd. This change was announced previously and is gradually rolling out over several releases. In this release, it's available in the following regions: asia-east1, asia-east2, asia-northeast2, asia-northeast3, asia-south2, asia-southeast2, australia-southeast1, australia-southeast2, europe-central2, europe-north1, europe-north2, europe-southwest1, europe-west, europe-west10, europe-west12, europe-west6, europe-west8, europe-west9, me-central1, me-central2, me-west1, northamerica-northeast2, northamerica-south1, southamerica-east1, southamerica-west1, us-east5, us-south1, us-west, and us-west3.

To create ephemeral Dataproc clusters, Cloud Data Fusion uses the Dataproc 2.3 image by default ( CDAP-21187 ). The pipeline JSON size limit for creating new pipelines and importing pipelines as JSON is increased to 5MB (previously 2MB) ( ). On the Pipeline details page, the inbound triggers sidebar features a paginated list of pipelines where you can select the pipelines you want to add to the trigger. Additionally, a refresh button is added to update the existing list of triggers and pipelines ( CDAP-21195 ). Fixed Fixed in Cloud Data Fusion 6.11.1: To prevent storage issues on static Dataproc clusters, temporary pipeline data is automatically deleted after a successful run ( CDAP-21076 ). Fixed an issue that prevented Expression Language (EL) from being used within user-defined directives ( CDAP-21204 ). Fixed an issue where a pipeline would fail when reading an encrypted file from Cloud Storage using Tink ( PLUGIN-1717 ). Deprecated Dataproc 2.0 is no longer supported in Cloud Data Fusion version 6.11.1 and later. 2025-07-25 Feature You can now attach tags to Cloud Data Fusion instances during instance creation.

Improved timestamp handling : Version 1.11.0 introduced improvements to timestamp handling. To address backward compatibility for these changes, two new hidden fields are introduced in Oracle batch source configurations: treatPrecisionlessNumAsDeci and treatAsOldTimestamp . Both flags default to false . To enable these flags, edit the respective values in your exported connection JSON (if using connections) or pipeline JSON (if not using connections) before re-importing or re-deploying ( PLUGIN-1893 ). 2025-06-12 Changed The Elasticsearch plugin version 1.11.0 is available in Cloud Data Fusion version 6.11.0.

By default, the mirrored backend service receives all requests, even if the original traffic is being split between multiple weighted backend services. You can now configure the mirrored backend service to receive only a percentage of the requests by using the mirrorPercent flag to specify the percentage of requests to be mirrored, expressed as a value between 0 and 100.0. For an example, see Set up traffic management for regional external Application Load Balancers . This feature is available in General availability . 2025-09-17 Security A security fix was made which changes the behavior of requests and responses sent with the Transfer-Encoding: Chunked header to be more RFC 9112 compliant. The RFC states that both the chunked_body and the last-chunk fields must end in CRLF . This is now enforced. 2025-09-12 Changed The global and classic external Application Load Balancers implemented on Google Front-Ends (GFEs) now support HTTP/1.0 explicitly as a protocol during ALPN (Application-Layer Protocol Negotiation) negotiation. Previously, when the GFEs didn't support HTTP/1.0 explicitly, the GFE would return an SSL_TLSEXT_ERR_NOACK response, disable ALPN, and fall back to using HTTP/1 (which includes HTTP/1.0 and HTTP/1.1) as the default application protocol. After this change, GFEs will instead return HTTP/1.0 , which provides clients with positive confirmation that their advertised HTTP/1.0 was accepted. You are not expected to make any changes with this update. If a TLS handshake with HTTP/1.0 is unsuccessful, please contact support . 2025-08-26 Feature The internal and external passthrough Network Load Balancers now support load balancing to unmanaged instance groups comprised of IPv6-only VM instances. Protocol forwarding also supports IPv6-only target instances. For more details, see the following pages: Protocol forwarding overview Backend service-based external passthrough Network Load Balancer overview Internal passthrough Network Load Balancer overview Set up an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer with IPv6-only subnets and backends This feature is available in General Availability . 2025-08-05 Feature Cross-region internal Application Load Balancers can now route requests for static content to Cloud Storage buckets. For more information, see Set up a cross-region internal Application Load Balancer with Cloud Storage buckets . This capability is now in General Availability . 2025-07-30 Changed Starting October 15, 2025, the global and classic external Application Load Balancers are improving HTTP header handling for headers with obs-fold values to comply with the RFC 9112 standard Previously, these load balancers would forward HTTP headers with obs-fold values (those split across multiple lines, with subsequent lines starting with a space or a tab) without any changes. Starting October 15, 2025, each obs-fold will be replaced with one or more space characters (SP octets) before forwarding the message upstream. This ensures that the header is correctly interpreted as a single line, as required by the HTTP specification. What you need to do Review your current client applications and backend services before October 15, 2025 and ensure that they generate HTTP headers with obs-fold values in a single-line format when communicating with these load balancers. Because the obs-fold header fields have been deprecated in RFC 9112, compliant clients and servers should already avoid using this format. However, there is a possibility that services that specifically rely on the old, non-compliant multi-line format of headers with obs-fold values might experience unexpected behavior. You should proactively check your backend service logs for any errors originating from your services due to the modified obs-fold headers. For more information on the HTTP specification regarding headers with obs-fold values, review RFC 9112, Section 5.2: Obsolete Line Folding . 2025-07-28 Feature Global external Application Load Balancers now support the JA4 fingerprint . The JA4 fingerprint can be added to a custom request header using the tls_ja4_fingerprint variable. This capability is now in General Availability . 2025-07-09 Feature Application Load Balancers and Proxy Network Load Balancers now support TLS certificates with large key sizes. Previously, these load balancers supported only certificates with RSA-2048 or ECDSA P-256 key types. With this update, you can now use self-managed certificates with RSA-3072, RSA-4096, and ECDSA P-384 keys. Key details : Supported key types (for self-managed certificates): RSA-2048, RSA-3072, RSA-4096, ECDSA P-256, and ECDSA P-384 Load balancing coverage for self managed certificates: Certificate Manager SSL certificates: Global and regional load balancing Compute Engine SSL Certificates: Regional load balancing Pricing: An additional charge of $0.45 per 1 million connections applies with certificates that use RSA-3072 and RSA-4096 key types. There are no per-connection charges for certificates that use RSA-2048, ECDSA P-256, or ECDSA P-384 key types. For more information, see the documentation for Supported key types . This capability is now in General Availability . 2025-07-08 Feature Zonal affinity, configured on the backend service of an internal passthrough Network Load Balancer, lets you limit cross-zone traffic, reduce latency, and improve performance, all while maintaining the benefits of a multi-zonal architecture. Internal passthrough Network Load Balancers support three zonal affinity options that offer varying degrees of preference for routing new connections to eligible backends that are in the same zone as a supported client. For more information, see Zonal affinity for internal passthrough Network Load Balancers . This feature is in Preview . 2025-06-26 Feature In typical HTTPS communication, neither the load balancer nor the backend verify each other's identity, assuming that they are within a secure perimeter and can be trusted. However, when perimeter security needs reinforcement or communication extends beyond the perimeter, backend mTLS becomes essential. Backend mTLS ensures secure communication by requiring both the load balancer and the backend to mutually verify their identities. With backend authenticated TLS , the load balancer verifies the backend server's certificate by checking its chain of trust, thereby confirming the backend's identity. Conversely, with backend mTLS , the backend server verifies the client certificate presented by the load balancer. Together, these mechanisms enable backend mTLS, ensuring that both parties validate each other's identity. Backend mTLS complements frontend mTLS, which is already generally available (GA). For details, see the following: Backend mTLS overview Set up backend authenticated TLS Set up backend mTLS This capability is in General Availability for global external Application Load Balancers. 2025-06-13 Feature Cloud Load Balancing supports load balancing to multi-NIC instances that use Dynamic NICs . This capability is in Preview . 2025-06-03 Feature Application Load Balancers now support the use of custom metrics that let you configure your load balancer's traffic distribution behavior to be based on metrics specific to your application or infrastructure requirements, rather than Google Cloud's standard utilization or rate-based metrics. Defining custom metrics for your load balancer gives you the flexibility to route application requests to the backend instances and endpoints that are most optimal for your workload. For more information, see Custom metrics for Application Load Balancers . This capability is in General availability . Feature Cleartext HTTP/2 over TCP, also known as H2C, lets you use HTTP/2 without TLS.

This fix ensures that all data is accurately processed and transmitted within the pipeline. This improvement is available in recent Dataflow service releases, and is automatically enabled when using Dataflow Runner v2. Note: After this fix, pipelines that previously experienced data loss due to this issue might consume more resources (such as CPU, memory, and processing time) because more data is being processed. This increase in resource usage is expected and reflects the correct behavior of the pipeline. 2025-08-11 Feature Dataflow now automatically detects performance bottlenecks in streaming jobs. You can see the cause of the bottleneck in the Step Info panel to help with troubleshooting.

This lets you grant capacity to selected processors and maintain a steady real-time, high-volume processing flow for document processing requests. For the necessary steps, read make a capacity reservation request . 2025-09-23 Feature Custom classifier model pretrained-classifier-v1.5-2025-08-05 powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash is in Preview . It has ML processing available for US and EU regions, a maximum page limit of 30 pages, and processing requests of 120 pages per minute. Unlike the prior custom classifier, which used classical machine learning, this version features a new platform. It accommodates: High accuracy immediately, based on the document classes you define. Few-shot learning to further improve accuracy. Use of descriptions when labeling for more context and insight for document classes. More accurate results with the same training dataset on the fine-tuned generative AI model, compared to the trained version. Autolabeling documents for fine-tuning and evaluation. Generative AI to fine-tune and heighten accuracy. For more information on processor versions, see Managing processor versions . 2025-09-10 Deprecated Custom Extractor version pretrained-foundation-model-v1.4-2025-02-05 will no longer be accessible on February 5, 2026 . To avoid service disruptions, migrate to a later version such as pretrained-foundation-model-v1.5-2025-05-05 or pretrained-foundation-model-v1.5-pro-2025-06-20 . To learn more about the migration process, refer to our Manage processor versions documentation. 2025-09-09 Announcement Document AI supports two service tiers and associated quotas: provisioned and best effort tiers. The base is provisioned tier quota, which provides 120 pages per minute for Gemini 2.0 and 2.5 Flash LLM and 30 pages per minute for Gemini 2.5 Pro LLM. If you require more volume, best effort tier quota provides 120 pages per minute for Gemini 2.0 2.5 Flash and 60 pages per minute for Gemini 2.5 Pro, and is only used once the provisioned quota has been exhausted. This applies to quotas BestEffortOnlineProcessDocumentPagesPerMinutePerProjectUS , and EU , and best_effort_online_process_document_pages_us and eu in the console. Best effort can get up to 240 pages per minute for custom data extractor models v1.4 and v1.5 with a quota increase request (QIR). You can make a QIR by contacting your sales team representative. There is no service level agreement (SLA) for best effort tier. 2025-09-03 Feature Custom extractor model pretrained-foundation-model-v1.5-pro-2025-06-20 is available as General Availability ( GA ). For more information about available models, see the custom extractor page. 2025-08-29 Feature Derived entity and signature detection are now supported in Custom Extractor models pretrained-foundation-model-v1.4-2025-02-05 as General Availability (GA) and pretrained-foundation-model-v1.5-2025-05-05 , as well as pretrained-foundation-model-v1.5-pro-2025-06-20 as Preview. Signature detection lets you identify handwritten signatures by using visual cues in the document. Derived entity detection lets you deduce entities by inference without requiring the value to be explicitly present in the text. You can use this feature to deduce the country in an address, counting items in a table, or detecting if an ID is fake. These can be enabled in the console when creating labels or by using the DocumentSchema.EntityType resource in the API. For more information, read Custom extractor with derived fields and choose label attributes . 2025-07-22 Feature Custom extractor model pretrained-foundation-model-v1.5-pro-2025-06-20 powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro is in Public Preview . It has ML processing available for US and EU regions, and 30 page per minute processing requests. For more information, see Managing processor versions . 2025-07-04 Feature Document AI now supports Identity and Access Management (IAM) deny policies. These policies allow you to define deny rules that prevent certain principals from using certain permissions to access Google Cloud resources, regardless of the roles they're granted. For more information, read Deny policy overview and Document AI security and compliance . Feature Document AI VPC service controls (VPC-SC) integration now supports identity groups. For more information on setting up VPC-SC identity groups, read Configure identity groups and third-party identities in ingress and egress rules . 2025-07-03 Feature The Document AI CDE processor now supports merging the child entities of nested entities that extend across several pages. This is supported in custom extractor model pretrained-foundation-model-v1.5-2025-05-05 . This change is automatically present in existing and newly created processors. For customers with existing v1.5 processors to make use of this feature, you must relabel the nested entities in different pages. To learn more about the labeling process, refer to our Label documents documentation. 2025-06-30 Feature Custom Extractor model pretrained-foundation-model-v1.5-2025-05-05 is in General Availability ( GA ) and has fine-tuning available for the US and EU. From version v1.4 and later, we will use a new quota for online processing called Number of online process document pages per minute per processor type and model version . This quota will be enforced at a per-page and per-foundation model level. There will be no change to the batch processing quota. These can be enabled in the console when creating labels and by using the DocumentSchema.EntityType .

This means that active conversations, finished tabs, and recently closed sessions remain as they were before the refresh. Feature Search in email channel by email address and name Agents can now search for email sessions by email address and name in the email adapter. User experience change: The search pane in the email adapter includes two new fields: Email Address and Name .

Fixed The following issues were addressed in this release: Fixed an issue that prevented administrators from configuring virtual agents on the top level for IVR queues. Fixed an issue where attempting to configure automatic redirection settings for the top level of an IVR queue returned an error. Fixed in issue that caused incorrect agent monitoring and reporting data when a virtual agent escalated a call to a queue in a different language. Fixed issue for HubSpot users where the call adapter got stuck on a non-functional reconnect page after a session expired. Fixed an issue for HubSpot users where the Delay call record creation until the call is connected to agent checkbox didn't appear in the CRM Record Creation Details pane. Fixed an issue that prevented agents from ending direct SMS chat sessions. Fixed an issue for Microsoft Windows 11 users that prevented agents from entering Japanese characters in the chat screen during chat sessions and into the notes during wrap-up. Fixed an issue where SDK custom data that was passed using the web SDK didn't appear in the agent adapter. Fixed an issue that prevented custom links entered in the chat adapter from being converted into clickable links. Fixed an issue in the chat screen of the chat adapter where the Missed target response time message was partially obscured by the formatting toolbar. Fixed an issue where agents couldn't initiate a callback to a missed agent-to-agent call from the History tab of the agent adapter. Fixed an issue where predictive outbound calling campaigns stalled and incorrectly moved contacts to the Redialed list before retrying them. This prevented the campaigns from completing successfully. Fixed an issue in the Call Details pane where the Recording Message Sequence settings were incorrectly inactive when the Play Call Recording Messages checkboxes were cleared. Administrators: In the Call Details pane, we changed Recording Message Sequence to Recording Message Sequence for Outbound Calls for clarity. * Fixed an issue where the customized greeting for an automatic redirection rule didn't play for calls that entered the queue using a Direct Access Phone (DAP) number. * Fixed an issue that occurred when a call was made from the global contact list. On the Details tab of the call adapter, the destination name didn't display. Instead, the destination phone number displayed. * Fixed an agent desktop issue where an agent status that was configured with a role restriction mistakenly appeared in the status list for a user assigned to that restricted role. * Fixed an issue where searching for an inbound-only queue on the Phone Number Management page failed to return a result. * Fixed an issue that caused queue duration and wait duration to be reported as 0 . This occurred when the Call Service Level Target on a queue settings page was set to a number that exceeded the maximum allowed limit. * Fixed an issue where a team assigned to a preference profile added only 1 user to the profile's users count, instead of adding the total number of users on the team. * Fixed an issue where agents were timed out for inactivity while composing an email in the email adapter. * Fixed an issue where users with a custom role were unable to save changes in the Chat Settings pane, even when their role had View and Edit permissions. * Fixed an issue that occurred after an agent configured their own hours of operation settings in the agent adapter. Those settings didn't appear for administrators in the agent's user profile on the Settings > Users & Team > Manage Users & Teams page. This prevented the administrator from making other edits to the agent's profile without overwriting the agent's hours of operation settings. * Fixed an issue where CRM tickets weren't created for some calls. * Fixed an issue where outbound SIP calls incorrectly appended data parameters, causing calls to fail. 2025-10-09 Announcement Version 3.39 is released All release notes published on this date are part of version 3.39.

Fixed The following issues were addressed in this release: Fixed an issue where incoming chats took precedence over the in-progress chat. User experience change : When a new chat appears in the agent adapter, it no longer takes focus away from the in-progress chat. The in-progress retains focus. * Fixed a web SDK issue where sensitive data sent by an end-user was redacted for both the end-user and the agent, instead of just for the agent. * Fixed an issue where the contact list in the agent adapter wouldn't load the full list of contacts. * Fixed an issue where an agent clicking an email in the agent adapter returned an Email Not Found error. * Fixed an issue where managers assigned to multiple teams were unable to view agent statistics for every team they were assigned to. * Fixed an issue for ServiceNow users where call_duration was using the earliest connected_at time instead of the latest connected_at time, causing call durations to appear longer than they actually were. * Fixed an issue in the Settings > Developer Settings > External Storage pane where language checkboxes were associated with the Co-browse Recordings checkbox instead of the Session Data Feed checkbox. Administrators : In the Settings > Developer Settings > External Storage pane, the languages checkboxes have moved from the Co-browse Recordings checkbox to the Session Data Feed checkbox. * Fixed an issue where agent-initiated outbound calls were using the default number for the selected queue instead of the number chosen by the agent. * Fixed an issue where the downloaded session chat data report contained an extra quotation mark. * Fixed an issue where users received an email telling them to create a password after Single Sign-On (SSO) was turned on. * Fixed an issue where SSO configuration settings in the user's instance were deleted after they turned off SSO. * Fixed an issue where an administrator couldn't configure agent status restrictions without exposing them to agents. * Fixed an issue where custom contact lists could only be replaced, and not removed, after they were assigned to a team. * Fixed an issue where the inheritance indicator and Reset to parent button was missing from the queue level Contact List Management pane. * Fixed an issue where the SMS and Web chat availability preferences in the agent adapter were the reverse of how they were configured. * Fixed an issue where queue transfer restrictions were not saved after being configured. * Fixed an issue that occurred when a user attempted to name a new queue.

On June 15th, 2025 , Salesforce is rolling out an automatic upgrade to its International Components for Unicode (ICU) locale data. This affects how date, time, number, and currency formatting are handled across Apex, Visualforce, and Lightning components. This change affects Salesforce integrations that are using Apex API versions earlier than 45.0. These integrations use the legacy Java locale behavior, which could cause formatting discrepancies, incorrect parsing, or runtime errors. Solution Google has reviewed the CCaaS managed package and has updated the impacted classes to use safe, ICU-compatible parsing and formatting methods. This includes cleaning up legacy code that uses older API versions, which might affect this transition. The following table shows the affected classes: Affected classes Name API version UJETUtilsController 35.0 UJETUtilsControllerTests 35.0 UJETJWT 43.0 UJETJWTTests 43.0 UJETPageController 43.0 Required action To ensure compatibility with the Salesforce ICU update and prevent any operational impact, you must complete the following action before June 15th, 2025 : Install the v1.40 update . This installation updates the affected classes. No further action is required. What happens if you don't upgrade? If any part of your integration or Apex code uses versions earlier than 45.0 after June 15th, Salesforce will not apply the ICU formatting to those sections. This could potentially lead to issues, including the following: Incorrect date and time parsing Unexpected errors in workflows or automations Mismatch between Lightning and Classic behavior Breakage in integrations expecting consistent locale handling Google considers the affected classes in CC_AGENT_APP v1.38 to be safe. While some of the affected classes have legacy methods that are affected by this update, they are not being actively used and will be deprecated in version 1.40.

User experience change : When a new chat appears in the agent adapter, it no longer takes focus away from the in-progress chat. The in-progress retains focus. * Fixed a web SDK issue where sensitive data sent by an end-user was redacted for both the end-user and the agent, instead of just for the agent. * Fixed an issue where the contact list in the agent adapter wouldn't load the full list of contacts. * Fixed an issue where an agent clicking an email in the agent adapter returned an Email Not Found error. * Fixed an issue where managers assigned to multiple teams were unable to view agent statistics for every team they were assigned to. * Fixed an issue for ServiceNow users where call_duration was using the earliest connected_at time instead of the latest connected_at time, causing call durations to appear longer than they actually were. * Fixed an issue in the Settings > Developer Settings > External Storage pane where language checkboxes were associated with the Co-browse Recordings checkbox instead of the Session Data Feed checkbox. Administrators : In the Settings > Developer Settings > External Storage pane, the languages checkboxes have moved from the Co-browse Recordings checkbox to the Session Data Feed checkbox. * Fixed an issue where agent-initiated outbound calls were using the default number for the selected queue instead of the number chosen by the agent. * Fixed an issue where the downloaded session chat data report contained an extra quotation mark. * Fixed an issue where users received an email telling them to create a password after Single Sign-On (SSO) was turned on. * Fixed an issue where SSO configuration settings in the user's instance were deleted after they turned off SSO. * Fixed an issue where an administrator couldn't configure agent status restrictions without exposing them to agents. * Fixed an issue where custom contact lists could only be replaced, and not removed, after they were assigned to a team. * Fixed an issue where the inheritance indicator and Reset to parent button was missing from the queue level Contact List Management pane. * Fixed an issue where the SMS and Web chat availability preferences in the agent adapter were the reverse of how they were configured. * Fixed an issue where queue transfer restrictions were not saved after being configured. * Fixed an issue that occurred when a user attempted to name a new queue. The name field abruptly lost focus after the first character, forcing the user to enter the queue name again. * Fixed an issue where creating an instance would time out and fail. * Fixed an issue that prevented reports from being downloaded. * Fixed an issue where the chat history for blended SMS sessions failed to save. * Fixed an issue where the Transfer failed message didn't appear. This occurred when an agent failed to pick up a transferred call before the transferred call expiration time expired. * Fixed an issue where IVR call recordings failed to save or were corrupted. This resulted in recordings that were only one second long, were saved in the wrong format, or weren't saved at all. * Fixed an issue where completed chat sessions appeared in the chats waiting area of agent desktop. * Fixed an issue for CRM users with voicemails that are attached directly to tickets. An incorrect \"External Storage must be configured\" warning appeared when configuring voicemail options for IVR queues. * Fixed an issue where transfer restrictions that were configured and saved for a web queue did not appear correctly the next time the Transfer Restrictions pane for that queue was viewed. * Fixed an issue where the unread message count in the chat pane was inconsistent when viewing it from multiple browser tabs. * Fixed an issue in virtual assistant reporting where the finish_reason property was incorrectly assigned to the undefined value. Now the finish_reason property is assigned to descriptive values that describe the reason for the conclusion of the chat session. * Fixed an issue where PDF transcripts of chat sessions contained malformed links. * Fixed an issue in historical reports where the fields in the Failed Reason Description column were blank. * Fixed an issue where CSAT scores were missing from some advanced reporting dashboards. * Fixed an issue for HubSpot users that caused long delays in case creation for inbound calls. * Fixed an issue where the photo and video files that the agent provided in pre-session Smart Actions didn't appear in the CRM. * Fixed an issue where agents in Unavailable status couldn't see waiting web chats. * Fixed an issue where HTML was not rendering properly in virtual agent messages in the agent adapter * Fixed an issue where agents were not switching into Wrap-up Exceeded status after a breakthrough call. * Fixed an agent desktop issue where administrators were unable to assign announcements to some teams or agents. * Fixed an agent desktop issue where agents couldn't copy text to the clipboard from an agent desktop custom panel. * Fixed an agent desktop issue where the term \"Anonymous User\" wasn't being translated into French. * Fixed an issue where the UJET_ID and ANI variables weren't passed correctly for SIP calls. * Fixed an issue where the chat adapter froze when agents switched between chats. * Fixed an issue on the Agents page of the Google Cloud CCaaS portal where administrators couldn't switch between session types. * Fixed an issue where a newly added Agent Assist platform displayed as Invalid even though it was valid. * Fixed an issue for Salesforce users where the call button didn't work when an agent attempted to call a number that was attached to a record for a previous call. * Fixed an issue where audio files with accented characters in their file names failed to play back when using a storage proxy. * Fixed an agent desktop issue where the UJET_ID variable in the custom URL for a custom panel wasn't being passed correctly. * Fixed an issue where calls originating from a native campaign generated two CRM tickets for the same interaction. * Fixed latency issues with web SDK Telnyx calls. * Fixed an issue where outbound Bring Your Own Carrier (BYOC) calls used a number other than the one agents selected in the agent adapter. * Fixed a Telnyx chatbot worker failure issue where background jobs related to call processing and chatbot escalations were failing and consuming excessive system resources. * Fixed an issue where calls to the bulk user upload endpoint returned a success status even when the uploads failed. * Fixed an issue in the chat waiting field of the agent desktop when multiple chats were in wrap-up. Instead of displaying Wrap-up in progress for all sessions in wrap-up, some sessions displayed Auto answered . * Fixed an issue in the queue group dashboard where the Callbacks waiting tile incorrectly included callbacks that were completed, abandoned, or failed. * Fixed an issue that caused inbound calls to disconnect if they were routed to an agent with a disabled microphone. * Fixed an issue for HubSpot users where logging the \"call started\" event ( create_activity ) in the ticket was delayed. * Fixed an issue that prevented transferred calls from being routed to available agents. * Fixed an issue in the agent adapter for French (Canada) where words weren't translated or were translated incorrectly. * Fixed an issue in call queue reporting where the Failed Reason Description for voice-scheduled mobile calls was not appearing. * Fixed an advanced reporting issue where CSAT ratings were not appearing correctly when creating custom dashboards. * Fixed an advanced reporting issue where callbacks waiting metrics didn't match in the following dashboards: Queue Groups Dashboard Calls and Queued Calls Status Dashboard .","title":"Fixed"},{"location":"google-cloud-contact-center-as-a-service/#2025-08-20","text":"","title":"2025-08-20"},{"location":"google-cloud-contact-center-as-a-service/#announcement_6","text":"Version 3.37 is released All release notes published on this date are part of version 3.37.

On June 15th, 2025 , Salesforce is rolling out an automatic upgrade to its International Components for Unicode (ICU) locale data. This affects how date, time, number, and currency formatting are handled across Apex, Visualforce, and Lightning components. This change affects Salesforce integrations that are using Apex API versions earlier than 45.0. These integrations use the legacy Java locale behavior, which could cause formatting discrepancies, incorrect parsing, or runtime errors. Solution Google has reviewed the CCaaS managed package and has updated the impacted classes to use safe, ICU-compatible parsing and formatting methods. This includes cleaning up legacy code that uses older API versions, which might affect this transition. The following table shows the affected classes: Affected classes Name API version UJETUtilsController 35.0 UJETUtilsControllerTests 35.0 UJETJWT 43.0 UJETJWTTests 43.0 UJETPageController 43.0 Required action To ensure compatibility with the Salesforce ICU update and prevent any operational impact, you must complete the following action before June 15th, 2025 : Install the v1.40 update . This installation updates the affected classes. No further action is required. What happens if you don't upgrade? If any part of your integration or Apex code uses versions earlier than 45.0 after June 15th, Salesforce will not apply the ICU formatting to those sections. This could potentially lead to issues, including the following: Incorrect date and time parsing Unexpected errors in workflows or automations Mismatch between Lightning and Classic behavior Breakage in integrations expecting consistent locale handling Google considers the affected classes in CC_AGENT_APP v1.38 to be safe. While some of the affected classes have legacy methods that are affected by this update, they are not being actively used and will be deprecated in version 1.40. Regardless, Google still recommends installing the v1.40 update. Not upgrading can potentially impact other solutions that are installed on the environment, as described in this communication. Defer the update As described in Enable the ICU Locale Formats , you can defer the automatic rollout of this update. To defer this update, follow these steps: From the Quick Find search box in Setup , enter User Interface . On the User Interface page, deselect the Enable ICU locale formats as part of the scheduled rollout checkbox. Important : This will only be effective if completed before June 15th 2025 .","title":"Announcement"},{"location":"google-cloud-contact-center-as-a-service/#2025-06-05","text":"","title":"2025-06-05"},{"location":"google-cloud-contact-center-as-a-service/#announcement_17","text":"Patch 3.35.15 is released This patch does the following: Fixes an issue in agent desktop.

Feature The following features were added in 1.33.0-gke.799: GA : Introduced an Envoy sidecar into the GKE Identity Service to increase security, reliability, and performance. GA : Added support for the Ubuntu 24.04 LTS operating system with Linux kernel versions, such as 6.8 and 6.11. Support for Linux kernel 6.14 is explicitly excluded. GA : Added the ability to override the cluster-level pod density setting for individual node pools. Preview : Added Node Agent to give you the ability to transition from using Ansible over SSH for cluster operations to a more secure, agent-based model. Added bmctl nodeagent commands to provide a straightforward and reliable process of migrating existing clusters to use Node Agent. Preview : Added a bundled version of the NVIDIA GPU Operator (version 25.3.1). The bundled operator is an open-source solution for managing the NVIDIA software components needed to provision and manage GPU devices. Preview : Added Dynamic Resource Allocation, a Kubernetes API that lets you request and share generic resources, such as GPUs, among pods and containers. When enabled, this capability helps you run AI workloads by dynamically and precisely allocating the GPU resources within your bare metal clusters, improving resource utilization and performance for demanding workloads. Preview : Added vertical Pod autoscaling, which lets you analyze and set CPU and memory resources required by Pods. Instead of having to set up-to-date CPU requests and limits and memory requests and limits for the containers in your Pods, you can configure vertical Pod autoscaling to provide recommended values for CPU and memory requests and limits that you can use to manually update your Pods, or you can configure vertical Pod autoscaling to automatically update the values. Preview : Added support for skip minor version cluster upgrades. You can directly upgrade your cluster control plane nodes (and entire cluster if worker node pools aren't pinned at a lower version) to two minor versions above the current version. Added the bmctl upgrade intermediate-version to print the intermediate version for a skip minor version upgrade. Surface failures from node pool status to the RecentFailures field in cluster status. Surface failures from failed preflight checks triggered by the cluster controller to the RecentFailures field in cluster status. Changed The following functional changes were made in 1.33.0-gke.799: Changed logging behavior so that kubeadm logs show up in the journald of the node machine where kubeadm runs. To help prevent stale ARP cache issues, iptables-persistent is installed in Debian nodes. Cluster manifests are deployed using a Kubernetes job, allowing the cluster operator to be more responsive to cluster events. Updated the validation checks for cluster upgrades to enforce the cluster version skew rules for user clusters. If the upgrade version information for a user cluster doesn't comply with the version skew rules, the upgrade is halted. Updated health checks and upgrade preflight checks to inspect for kubeadm certificate expiration. Updated etcd version to 3.5.21. Removed support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8 as it is beyond the Red Hat support window . Removed support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS as it has reached the end of standard security maintenance in May 2025 . Upgraded ansible-core to 2.16.4 to support Python 3.12. Increased the RSA key size for Cluster API certifications to 4096 bits for improved security. Fixed The following issues were fixed in 1.33.0-gke.799: Fixed an issue where restoring a cluster that has a node with a GPU causes instability of pods on the nodes. Fixed an issue that caused the Ansible playbook for handling Cloud Audit Logging to fail and not complete. Fixed an issue that caused nodes to get stuck in maintenance mode. Health checks have been updated so that the network check job skips connectivity checks for nodes that are in maintenance mode. Fixed an issue where the CronJob for periodic health checks wasn't updating after configuration changes. Fixed vulnerabilities listed in Vulnerability fixes .

Changed GA: Changed the cluster creation process so that all new clusters are advanced clusters . Additionally, all cluster upgrades to 1.33 are automatically converted to advanced clusters. Upgraded the etcd component to version 3.4.33. Feature GA: Enabled the vsphere-metrics-exporter component for advanced clusters. This exporter provides greater visibility into the VMware vSphere environment by collecting key performance and health metrics. GA: Added support for VM-Host affinity groups in advanced clusters. This feature allows for the creation of rules that constrain cluster nodes to run on specific, predefined groups of hosts. GA: Added support for automatic node resizing in advanced clusters. This feature optimizes resource use by automatically adjusting the CPU and memory allocated to control plane nodes in response to workload demands. Public Preview: Added support for Virtual Machine (VM) tracking using vSphere tags in advanced clusters. This feature simplifies resource management by automatically applying identifying tags to cluster VMs. GA: Introduced an Envoy proxy sidecar to the GKE Identity Service for clusters that use Controlplane V2. This change enhances the security, reliability, and performance of the authentication service.

Google Distributed Cloud software updates roll out gradually across regions. The latest version might not be immediately available on your Google Distributed Cloud connected deployment. Feature The following new functionality has been introduced in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected: Backup for VM workloads on GDC connected servers. You can now backup and restore virtual machine workloads on your Google Distributed Cloud connected servers deployment, including scheduling. For more information, see Back up a virtual machine . Configurable runtime class for container workloads. As part of gVisor integration in Google Distributed Cloud connected, you can now specify the default runtime class for container workloads at both Pod and cluster level.

VNC support for accessing VM workloads through Connect Gateway. You can now use VNC to access your virtual machine workloads through Connect Gateway. Security Security mitigations for the following vulnerabilities have been implemented in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected: OS layer security mitigations: CVE-2025-31498, CVE-2024-48615, CVE-2016-1585. GDC software-only security mitigations: All mitigations listed in the GDC software-only release notes up to version 1.32.100 (inclusive). Libraries The following Google Distributed Cloud connected components have been updated: GDC software-only has been updated to version 1.32.100. (This component was formerly known as GKE on Bare Metal and as Anthos Clusters on Bare Metal.) Kubernetes has been updated to version 1.32.4-gke.200. Fixed The following issues have been resolved in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected: Machines no longer experience intermittent connectivity loss. Google Distributed Cloud connected machines no longer experience intermittent connectivity loss; the underlying rare condition that can occur with fleet credential management has been resolved. VNC sessions through Connect Gateway are now more resilient. The stability of VNC sessions to virtual machine workloads through Connect Gateway has been improved. Issue This release of Google Distributed Cloud connected contains the following known issues: The gvisor runtime class is incompatible with Symcloud Storage persistent volumes in block mode. If you set a workload that uses Symcloud Storage persistent volumes in block mode to use the gvisor runtime class, the workload fails. Symcloud Storage persistent volumes in filesystem mode are not affected. Cilium does not differentiate between TCP and UDP protocols. Cilium does not differentiate between TCP and UDP protocols for services that use both protocols on the same port number and routes traffic for both protocols to the same backend pods. This can render such services non-functional. To work around this issue, use a different port for each protocol. Overlapping the Pod and cluster CIDR blocks for secondary networks causes network failure. If you specify overlapping CIDR blocks for Pods and clusters using the annotations.networking.gke.io/gdce-pod-cidr and annotations.networking.gke.io/gke-gateway-clusterip-cidr annotations in the Network resource, the Google Distributed Cloud connected virtual networking subsystem might behave erratically, including loss of connectivity. Follow the guidelines in (Optional) Configure island mode to prevent this issue. The anthos-multinet container might take up to two hours to fully start. You might intermittently experience a slower than normal startup for the anthos-multinet container (up to two hours). To remedy this issue, contact Google Support . 2025-08-15 Libraries The following Google Distributed Cloud connected components have been updated: EdgeOS kernel has been updated to version 5.15.177. GDC software-only has been updated from version 1.30.500 to version 1.31.400. (This component was formerly known as GKE on Bare Metal and as Anthos Clusters on Bare Metal.) Kubernetes has been updated from version 1.30 to version 1.31. Symcloud Storage has been updated from version 5.4.14 to version 5.4.16. Fixed The following issues have been resolved in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected: Storage is now freed immediately upon cluster deletion. After deleting a cluster, the storage used by that cluster is now freed up immediately. You no longer have to manually delete all persistent volumes in a cluster before deleting the cluster itself. Virtual machine workloads no longer fail to restart or migrate if DHCP server address changes. If you are using DHCP to assign IP addresses to your virtual machine workloads and the IP address of your DHCP server changes, your virtual machine workloads now automatically restart and successfully complete migration. Issue This release of Google Distributed Cloud connected contains the following known issues: Machines can experience intermittent connectivity loss. Google Distributed Cloud connected machines can experience intermittent connectivity loss due to a rare condition that can occur with fleet credential management. To remedy this issue, contact Google Support . The anthos-multinet container might take up to two hours to fully start. You might intermittently experience a slower than normal startup for the anthos-multinet container (up to two hours). To remedy this issue, contact Google Support . Virtual machine workloads cannot coexist on the same virtual network with Pods that use DHCP for IP address assignment. This is because virtual machine workloads need the IPAMMode parameter set to external to use DHCP, while Pods need the IPAMMode parameter set to internal to use DHCP. Pods with static IP address are not affected by this. This behavior is by design. Announcement This is a minor release of Google Distributed Cloud connected (version 1.10.0). Feature The following new functionality has been introduced in this release of Google Distributed Cloud connected: Pause and resume cluster software upgrades. Software upgrades for your Google Distributed Cloud connected clusters now automatically pause when a maintenance window ends and automatically resume when the next maintenance window starts.

This failure can occur if a Pod mounting an NFS volume runs on the same node as an NFS server Pod, and the NFS server Pod starts before the client Pod attempts to mount the volume. This scenario causes a conflict over the rpcbind service, which prevents the service from starting correctly on the node for the client Pod, leading to the mount failure. As a workaround, deploy this DaemonSet on all nodes where you mount the NFS volumes. The DaemonSet ensures that the required services start correctly. 2025-10-09 Feature For AI models deployed on a GKE cluster, you can view details about these deployments in the Google Cloud console. The pages include deployment details, logs, and observability dashboards . Feature The following networking features are available: In GKE version 1.33.4-gke.1055000 or later, you can control how external traffic reaches your Services on GKE clusters by using Network Service Tiers. You can configure the network tier to use either Standard Tier or Premium Tier when you create or update clusters or when you update LoadBalancer Services. For more information, see Configure external traffic with Network Service Tiers . Starting with GKE versions 1.33 and later, you can enable automatic IP address management (auto IPAM) on GKE clusters. Auto IPAM dynamically adds or removes additional IP address ranges for nodes and Pods as the cluster scales up or down. This feature eliminates the need for large, potentially wasteful, upfront IP reservations and manual intervention during cluster scaling. For more information, see Use auto IP address management . In GKE version 1.30.3-gke.1211000 and later, you can assign additional subnets to a VPC-native cluster. Additional subnets assigned to a cluster let you create new node pools where IPv4 addresses for both nodes and Pods come from the additional subnet ranges. This enhancement removes single-subnet limitations, increases scalability, and enhances the flexibility of your GKE clusters. For more information, see Add subnets to clusters . 2025-10-08 Changed (2025-R42) Version updates GKE cluster versions have been updated. New versions available for upgrades and new clusters.

From GKE version 1.32.7-gke.1079000 and later, the graceful node drain timeout has been increased from 10 minutes to 1 hour. For more information, see How cluster autoscaler works . Feature The InPlaceOrRecreate mode for Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) is now available for Public Preview in GKE. This mode uses In-Place Pod Resize (IPPR/IPPU) , which allows VPA to automatically adjust workload resources, without requiring Pod recreation. This seamless rightsizing capability helps ensure better service continuity and helps minimize costs by optimizing resource allocation, particularly during idle periods. VPA is enabled by default in Autopilot clusters. For Standard clusters, you must first enable VPA. For more information on configuring a VPA object, see Set Pod resource requests automatically . 2025-09-29 Changed (2025-R40) Version updates Note : Your clusters might not have these versions available.

Feature To improve security and workload isolation, GKE has introduced a new, dedicated service agent for logging and monitoring of GKE nodes on clusters running version 1.33 and later. For more information, see GKE service agents . What's changing? GKE will now use the following service agent for logging and monitoring on your nodes: service-{PROJECT_NUMBER}@gcp-sa-gkenode.iam.gserviceaccount.com This service agent has the minimal permissions GKE needs to operate nodes, which are included in the role/container.defaultNodeServiceAgent IAM role . Using a dedicated service agent helps to isolate the requirements of GKE-managed workloads from your own workloads. What's the impact? This change affects only GKE system workloads , which will now use the new service agent for their logging and monitoring capabilities. Your own workloads are not impacted. You might notice missing logs or metrics for your nodes if the new service agent doesn't have the necessary permissions. What do I need to do? In the vast majority of cases, no action is needed, as the role role/container.defaultNodeServiceAgent has been automatically granted to the new GKE Node Service Agent on your cluster project. However, you will need to re-apply the role role/container.defaultNodeServiceAgent to the new service agent in the following scenarios: You have automation that might have removed this role. You notice missing logs or metrics for your nodes. You can find the full list of permissions for this role in the IAM documentation .

This provides more granular control over auto-created node pools, enabling you to target specific workloads and optimize resource usage. For more information, see Node auto-provisioning and ComputeClasses . To use this feature, your cluster must meet both of the following requirements: Enrolled in the Rapid release channel. Running GKE version 1.33.3-gke.1136000 or later. Feature GKE Standard clusters now support Autopilot features, including the container-optimized compute platform and fully managed nodes, letting you use Autopilot's advantages without migrating to a dedicated Autopilot cluster. For more information, see Run Autopilot workloads in GKE Standard clusters . To use these features, your cluster must meet the following requirements: Enrolled in the Rapid release channel. Running GKE version 1.33.1-gke.1107000 or later. Issue Issue with A4X machine type compatibility on certain GKE versions Certain GKE versions are not compatible with the A4X machine type. The issue is that a Container-Optimized OS (COS) image that these GKE versions depend on was not built as a multi-architecture image. This incompatibility causes an exec format error on the Arm-based A4X machines. The issue affects GKE versions 1.33.2-gke.1377000 or later, and any versions earlier than 1.33.4-gke.1036000. 2025-09-23 Changed The following metrics are now only billed through Cloud Monitoring. If you were using any of these features through GKE Enterprise, your billing is automatically transitioned to the Cloud Monitoring SKU. These metrics use Google Cloud Managed Service for Prometheus to load metrics into Cloud Monitoring. The Cloud Monitoring charges for the ingestion of these metrics are based on the number of samples ingested. For more information, see Cloud Monitoring pricing .

For more information about the content of Kubernetes 1.34, read the Kubernetes 1.34 Release Notes . Changed Other changes in 1.34 containerd 2.1: GKE nodes are now upgraded to containerd 2.1. This release includes performance improvements such as faster image downloads. For a complete list of changes, see the official containerd 2.1 release notes . VPA InPlaceOrRecreate : This version introduces a new InPlaceOrRecreate mode in Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA) (Public Preview) powered by In-Place Pod Resize (IPPR/IPPU) that allows automatically rightsizing workloads often without recreating the Pod. This mode ensures seamless service continuity while minimizing costs during idle periods. If you haven't used VPA with your workloads before, enable Vertical Pod Autoscaler on your cluster and then create a VPA Object for a workload. Deprecated Deprecated in 1.34 The v1beta1 gRPC API between the Kubelet and DRA drivers is deprecated in this release in favor of the v1 API. This API will continue to function but we recommend that all drivers move to the v1 API to prepare for the eventual removal of the v1beta1 API. Changed CNI spec version for GKE Dataplane V2 updated to v1.1.0 Starting with GKE patch version 1.34, clusters using GKE Dataplane V2 are being updated from CNI spec v0.3.1 to v1.1.0. Action required: If you use your own CNI plugins in your GKE cluster (such as self-managed open-source Istio), you must upgrade them to a version compatible with CNI spec v1.1.0 to prevent errors. Feature GKE alpha clusters enable all alpha and the default beta feature gates, which help you to test and validate upcoming Kubernetes capabilities. You can now modify the feature gates to enable or disable differently from the default values, which provides more granular control when leveraging these experimental features. Note that alpha clusters shouldn't be used for production workloads to ensure that your workloads remain stable and performant. For more information, see Alpha clusters . Feature New features in Kubernetes 1.34 The Kubernetes Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) APIs are now generally available. For more information about using DRA in GKE, see About dynamic resource allocation in GKE . The Prioritized list and Admin access features have been promoted to beta and will be enabled by default. The kubelet API has been updated to report status on resources allocated through DRA. The Sleep Action for Pod prestop lifecycle hook is now GA. This can be used to delay Pod termination for graceful shutdown. Streaming List Response Encoding is now GA. It enables efficient handling of requests for large object collections, improving API server reliability and performance. In-Place Pod Resize , which was in beta, is now improved by adding support for decreasing memory limits with best-effort OOM protection. Improved deferred resize retries are also added, which are now prioritized and more responsive to resources becoming available. A new ResizeCompleted event records when a resize is completed. Feature On clusters with GKE Dataplane V2 that are on GKE version 1.34 and later, the ptp plugin is removed from the Container Network Interface (CNI) path.

Security GKE version 1.33.0-gke.1276000 and later remediate a low severity vulnerability, in which an attacker with the ability to patch Node resources by using the Kubernetes API could change specific node labels in clusters that use Workload Identity Federation for GKE. This could result in the attacker gaining access to node metadata, such as the IAM service account. To remediate this vulnerability, a validation policy is enforced that prevents unauthorized modifications to the node labels that control metadata protection. 2025-08-27 Changed (2025-R36) Version updates Note : Your clusters might not have these versions available.

These logs are available by default in Cloud Logging when the Ray operator addon is enabled in GKE. This integration helps you to monitor and debug the Ray Operator. Previously, accessing these logs required more complex steps. To view the logs, navigate to Cloud Logging Logs Explorer in the Google Cloud console and run a query to filter for the Ray Operator logs for your specific cluster. For more information, see View Ray Operator logs on GKE . Feature Starting on August 1, 2025, the Performance HorizontalPodAutoscaler profile is enabled by default for GKE Standard clusters that run GKE version 1.33.2-gke.4605000 and later and meet all of the Performance profile requirements . The Performance profile improves the reaction time, speed, and scalability of the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler. You can optionally disable the Performance profile . 2025-08-08 Feature You can now customize a node system configuration with the following new Kubelet, Sysctl, and Linux config options: kubeletConfig flags: topologyManager (on GKE versions 1.32.3-gke.1785000 and later) memoryManager (on GKE versions 1.32.3-gke.1785000 and later) maxParallelImagePulls (on GKE versions 1.33.1-gke.1918000 and later) singleProcessOomKill (on GKE versions 1.32.4-gke.1132000, 1.33.0-gke.1748000 and later) evictionSoft evictionSoftGracePeriod evictionMinimumReclaim evictionMaxPodGracePeriodSeconds sysctl flags: vm.overcommit_memory vm.overcommit_ratio vm.vfs_cache_pressure vm.dirty_ratio vm.dirty_background_ratio vm.dirty_expire_centisecs vm.dirty_writeback_centisecs vm.watermark_scale_factor vm.min_free_kbytes vm.swappiness fs.nr_open fs.file-max fs.inotify.max_user_watches fs.inotify.max_user_instances fs.aio-max-nr net.ipv4.tcp_max_orphans linuxConfig flags: transparentHugepageEnabled (on GKE versions 1.33.2-gke.4655000 and later) transparentHugepageDefrag (on GKE versions 1.33.2-gke.4655000 and later) Feature The C4 machine series now has General Availability machine types that support Local SSD storage options.

Announcement Control plane datastore maintenance Starting in May, 2025, Google is performing maintenance on the internal control plane datastore for all GKE clusters to improve scalability and reliability. We expect to complete these improvements across GKE by October, 2025. This maintenance is happening gradually across all GKE clusters, and will occur in your clusters only during configured maintenance windows. The maintenance process is expected to take approximately 15 minutes to complete during your cluster's maintenance window. Expected impact During the internal control plane datastore maintenance, the Kubernetes API server will be unavailable for 15 minutes , regardless of whether you use a regional cluster or a zonal cluster. During this 15-minute period, you won't be able to interact with the Kubernetes API server for your cluster. Consider the following potential disruptions to your normal workflows during the maintenance window for your cluster: Kubernetes API unavailability : you can't use the kubectl tool or any other Kubernetes API client to issue commands to the control plane, regardless of whether the cluster is regional or zonal. Attempts to deploy, modify, or query resources by using the Kubernetes API will fail during this period. Halted deployments: automated deployment pipelines (CI/CD) that interact with the Kubernetes API will fail to complete tasks such as deploying or updating applications in the cluster. Google Cloud console limitations : operations for the cluster in the Google Cloud console that communicate with the Kubernetes API might fail during the maintenance period. Delayed control plane automation : features that are managed by the control plane, such as the cluster autoscaler, Horizontal or Vertical Pod Autoscaling adjustments, or some node auto-repair operations might be paused until the API server is online. The following resources have no expected impact during the maintenance period: Running applications : any running applications and services on your nodes should continue to function without interruptions. Node pool operations : existing nodes should remain connected and operational. Network traffic : traffic in the data plane, such as traffic to and from your running workloads, shouldn't be affected. What you need to do No action is required from you for the maintenance to occur. To plan for this maintenance, we recommend that you do the following: Review maintenance windows : review your cluster's maintenance window and exclusions settings and schedule maintenance windows during periods that minimize disruptions to your normal workflows. Plan for Kubernetes API unavailability : if you run critical operations in your cluster that require access to the Kubernetes API, avoid scheduling these operations during maintenance windows. Fixed Important: This note is incorrect. For the correct note, see the entry for August 5, 2025 . A fix is available for an issue in which the Compute Engine Persistent Disk CSI driver failed with an invalid cpuString error on GKE nodes that used custom machine types. This issue prevented successful attachment and mounting of Persistent Disk volumes on affected nodes. The fix is available in the following GKE versions: 1.31.10-gke.1021000 and later 1.32.4-gke.1698000 and later 1.33.1-gke.1386000 and later 2025-07-25 Changed (2025-R31) Version updates Note : Your clusters might not have these versions available.

Requests are already incorporated into GKE DNS-based control plane public endpoints where hostnames end with us-central1.gke.goog . For all other GKE DNS-based control plane public endpoints, this will roll out between August 18, 2025 and August 22, 2025. Until mTLS and client certificate configuration options are available, the following details apply: A client certificate request in a TLS handshake doesn't mean that kubectl (or other compatible clients) must provide a client certificate. Client certificates are neither mandatory nor configurable. TLS libraries in current operating systems send a \"no client certificate\" response to the public endpoint's client certificate request. GKE DNS-based control plane public endpoints will not enforce client certificates or mTLS requirements until a future announcement about configuration options. If you use an intermediate proxy between kubectl (or other compatible clients) and a GKE DNS-based control plane public endpoint, ensure that it fully adheres to Section 7.4.4 of RFC 5246 , Section 4.4.2 of RFC 8446 , or Section 4.4.2.4 of RFC 8446 .

Feature GKE now provides insights and recommendations that help you to identify and remediate clusters where the etcd cluster state database size is approaching the limit. Implementing the recommendation helps you to keep your clusters stable and performant. 2025-05-27 Feature In GKE version 1.32.2-gke.1297000 and later, you can run GPU workloads on Confidential GKE Nodes with the A3 High machine type and NVIDIA H100 GPUs. This enables stronger data protection and integrity for GPU-accelerated computations running within GKE clusters and nodes. This feature is available in Preview . For more information, see Encrypt GPU workload data in use with Confidential GKE Nodes . Feature In GKE version 1.32.2-gke.1297000 and later, you can use the Intel TDX and AMD SEV-SNP Confidential Computing technologies with Confidential GKE Nodes. This feature is in General Availability . Use Confidential GKE Nodes to encrypt your workload data in-use through Compute Engine Confidential VMs for data and code confidentiality and integrity.

This failure can occur if a Pod mounting an NFS volume runs on the same node as an NFS server Pod, and the NFS server Pod starts before the client Pod attempts to mount the volume. This scenario causes a conflict over the rpcbind service, which prevents the service from starting correctly on the node for the client Pod, leading to the mount failure. As a workaround, deploy this DaemonSet on all nodes where you mount the NFS volumes. The DaemonSet ensures that the required services start correctly.","title":"Issue"},{"location":"google-kubernetes-engine/#2025-10-09","text":"","title":"2025-10-09"},{"location":"google-kubernetes-engine/#feature","text":"For AI models deployed on a GKE cluster, you can view details about these deployments in the Google Cloud console.

You can configure the network tier to use either Standard Tier or Premium Tier when you create or update clusters or when you update LoadBalancer Services. For more information, see Configure external traffic with Network Service Tiers . Starting with GKE versions 1.33 and later, you can enable automatic IP address management (auto IPAM) on GKE clusters. Auto IPAM dynamically adds or removes additional IP address ranges for nodes and Pods as the cluster scales up or down. This feature eliminates the need for large, potentially wasteful, upfront IP reservations and manual intervention during cluster scaling. For more information, see Use auto IP address management . In GKE version 1.30.3-gke.1211000 and later, you can assign additional subnets to a VPC-native cluster. Additional subnets assigned to a cluster let you create new node pools where IPv4 addresses for both nodes and Pods come from the additional subnet ranges. This enhancement removes single-subnet limitations, increases scalability, and enhances the flexibility of your GKE clusters.

We expect to complete these improvements across GKE by October, 2025. This maintenance is happening gradually across all GKE clusters, and will occur in your clusters only during configured maintenance windows. The maintenance process is expected to take approximately 15 minutes to complete during your cluster's maintenance window. Expected impact During the internal control plane datastore maintenance, the Kubernetes API server will be unavailable for 15 minutes , regardless of whether you use a regional cluster or a zonal cluster. During this 15-minute period, you won't be able to interact with the Kubernetes API server for your cluster. Consider the following potential disruptions to your normal workflows during the maintenance window for your cluster: Kubernetes API unavailability : you can't use the kubectl tool or any other Kubernetes API client to issue commands to the control plane, regardless of whether the cluster is regional or zonal. Attempts to deploy, modify, or query resources by using the Kubernetes API will fail during this period. Halted deployments: automated deployment pipelines (CI/CD) that interact with the Kubernetes API will fail to complete tasks such as deploying or updating applications in the cluster. Google Cloud console limitations : operations for the cluster in the Google Cloud console that communicate with the Kubernetes API might fail during the maintenance period. Delayed control plane automation : features that are managed by the control plane, such as the cluster autoscaler, Horizontal or Vertical Pod Autoscaling adjustments, or some node auto-repair operations might be paused until the API server is online. The following resources have no expected impact during the maintenance period: Running applications : any running applications and services on your nodes should continue to function without interruptions. Node pool operations : existing nodes should remain connected and operational. Network traffic : traffic in the data plane, such as traffic to and from your running workloads, shouldn't be affected. What you need to do No action is required from you for the maintenance to occur. To plan for this maintenance, we recommend that you do the following: Review maintenance windows : review your cluster's maintenance window and exclusions settings and schedule maintenance windows during periods that minimize disruptions to your normal workflows. Plan for Kubernetes API unavailability : if you run critical operations in your cluster that require access to the Kubernetes API, avoid scheduling these operations during maintenance windows.","title":"Control plane datastore maintenance"},{"location":"google-kubernetes-engine/#fixed_3","text":"Important: This note is incorrect.

This impact will change all any data collection pipelines that currently use the forwarder. Action required : If you're currently using the forwarder component, you must migrate your data collection workflows to an alternative mechanism before April 1, 2027. You'll need to use another data pipeline management application for log ingestion. We recommend that you migrate to the Bindplane OpenTelemetry (OTel) collector , which provides a scalable, open-standard solution for log and metric ingestion. The following are key dates to note: Apr 1, 2026 : New Google SecOps customers cannot use the forwarder component. Jan 1, 2027 : The forwarder is officially EOL. No further patches, including security patches, will be released. Apr 1, 2027 : Data is no longer allowed to be ingested from the forwarder component. Announcement Update CrowdStrike API permissions before decommission CrowdStrike is decommissioning its Detects API on September 30, 2025. This API has been replaced by the Alerts API. To ensure that your data feeds continue without interruption, you may need to update your API permissions. This change impacts you if your Google SecOps tenant meets both of the following conditions: You use the CrowdStrike Detection Monitoring API connector, which ingests the CS_DETECTS log type. The CrowdStrike API client configured for that feed lacks the permissions to read alerts Read. To prevent disruption to your CrowdStrike data ingestion, you must update your API client permissions before September 30, 2025. Follow the instructions in Migrate from CrowdStrike Detects API to Alerts API to migrate your configuration to use the Alerts API.

Improved log type distribution charts : updates charts for better readability and usability. 2025-06-16 Announcement The Release Candidate period of the following premium parsers has been extended from the end of May to the week of July 21, 2025: Crowdstrike Detection Monitoring (CS_DETECTS) Crowdstrike Falcon (CS_EDR) Microsoft Defender for Endpoint We recommend that you opt-in early and make any necessary adjustments before these updates become the default. 2025-06-08 Feature Playbook Permissions: Support for API Key Roles The platform has been updated to extend playbook permissions to also support the SOC Roles associated with API keys, in addition to the user SOC Roles. This enhancement affects how integrations using API keys interact with playbooks that have specific permission configurations. For example, GitSync now uses this capability to synchronize playbooks with restricted permissions. For more information on how playbook permissions work with users and API keys, see Playbook permissions . For specific instructions on configuring GitSync with restricted playbooks, see GitSync - Work with playbook permissions . Feature Advanced Reports: Case Custom Fields Advanced Reports (Looker) has been enhanced to include support for custom fields created for Cases. This enhancement allows users to leverage organization-specific data captured in custom fields to gain deeper insights and create tailored visualizations within Looker reports. Specific LookML formulas and filtering guidance are now available. For more information on how to use custom fields in Advanced Reports, see Use Custom Fields in Advanced Reports . 2025-06-04 Announcement The following parser documentation is now available: Collect Abnormal Security logs Collect Apache Cassandra logs Collect Darktrace logs Collect Nix Systems Ubuntu Server (Unix System) logs Collect 1Password logs Collect 1Password audit logs Collect Symantec Endpoint Protection logs Collect Symantec VIP Authentication Hub logs Collect Symantec VIP Enterprise Gateway logs Collect Symantec Web Isolation logs Collect Varonis logs Collect Oracle DB logs Collect Akeyless Vault logs Collect Attivo Networks BOTsink logs Collect Avaya Aura logs Collect BeyondTrust Endpoint Privilege Management logs Collect BeyondTrust Privileged Identity logs Collect Blue Coat ProxySG logs Collect Microsoft Exchange logs Collect MYSQL logs Collect Signal Sciences WAF logs Collect Symantec CloudSOC CASB logs 2025-06-03 Fixed User interface fixes There was an issue with highlighting regular expressions in Search and Rules Editor . Once you entered a regular expression, all subsequent text on the line would be highlighted as if it was also a regular expression (whether it was or wasn't). This issue has been fixed. Note that both string literals (specified with back ticks) and regular expressions are highlighted in the same color. There was an issue with uppercase keywords in Search and Rules Editor . They weren't being highlighted correctly. This issue has been fixed. 2025-05-29 Changed Google SecOps has updated the list of supported default parsers.

This impact will change all any data collection pipelines that currently use the forwarder. Action required : If you're currently using the forwarder component, you must migrate your data collection workflows to an alternative mechanism before April 1, 2027. You'll need to use another data pipeline management application for log ingestion. We recommend that you migrate to the Bindplane OpenTelemetry (OTel) collector , which provides a scalable, open-standard solution for log and metric ingestion. The following are key dates to note: Apr 1, 2026 : New Google SecOps customers cannot use the forwarder component. Jan 1, 2027 : The forwarder is officially EOL. No further patches, including security patches, will be released. Apr 1, 2027 : Data is no longer allowed to be ingested from the forwarder component.

Feature The Oracle JDBC driver has been updated to version 19.25. Feature For faster response time for queries in BigQuery, Looker will execute BigQuery queries by using jobCreationMode=JOB_CREATION_OPTIONAL . If BigQuery can return immediate results, it will run the query without creating a job, so the record in the Looker query history will have a BigQuery query ID instead of a BigQuery job ID. See the Understanding query performance metrics documentation page for more information about the BigQuery BI Engine metrics. Feature The Query Concurrency System Activity Explore is now available. This Explore can help you identify periods of high load and investigate performance bottlenecks that are related to database connection limits.

While the 2.0.0 API is backwards-compatible with Embed SDK 1.8.x, the underlying implementation has changed for some functionality. SDK 1.8.x exported a number of classes. SDK 2.0.0 replaces these classes with interfaces that are marked as deprecated (alternative interfaces are identified). We recommend that applications use the interfaces that have an 'I' prefix (the interfaces that have prefixes are identical to the interfaces that don't have them). Applications that are upgraded to SDK 2.0.0 should continue to work and behave as they did previously. To take advantage of the API improvements, some refactoring will be required. The following major changes are included in Embed SDK 2.0.0: Navigating between dashboards, Explores, and Looks no longer requires that an iframe be recreated. Instead, the loadDashboard , loadLook , loadExplore , and loadUrl methods can be used to navigate within the Looker iframe. connect now returns a unified connection rather than a connection that is related only to a dashboard, a Look, or an Explore. The unified connection allows embedding applications to detect a user navigating inside the iframe. Support for additional Looker embedded content has been added for Looker reports and query visualizations. Note: This item was added on June 13, 2025. Feature For period-over-period (PoP) measures, a new subparameter, value_to_date , is available. When a PoP measure is defined with value_to_date:yes , Looker will calculate the amount of time in the current timeframe at the time that the query is run and apply that amount of time when it calculates the values for previous periods. Feature The Firebolt JDBC driver has been updated to version 3.5.0. Feature The Hive JDBC driver has been updated to version 4.0.1. Feature The MS SQL JDBC driver has been updated to version 12.10.0. Feature The Teradata JDBC driver has been updated to version 20.00.00.45. Feature The Vertica JDBC driver has been updated to version 24.2.0-1. Feature The new Content Guardrails admin panel lets Looker admins limit both the ability for users to add or execute merged results queries on dashboards and the use of the dashboard auto-refresh option. Limiting merged results queries and dashboard auto-refreshes can reduce the number of queries that are sent to the database and improve dashboard performance. Note: This item was added on June 12, 2025. Feature The Looker Continuous Integration (CI) features let you run tests on your LookML project to deliver more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly data experiences. You can use the CI validators to catch issues with SQL, data test, content, and LookML before they hit production to verify your LookML and prevent query errors for your users. You can also configure the CI validators to run automatically when a pull request is submitted to your LookML repository. Note: This item was added on June 23, 2025. Fixed This release contains the following accessibility improvements: Increased contrast ratio for graphic elements, including icon bullets Improved contrast for download links and unemphasized text to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Level AA Fixed The Tile Actions kebab menu now includes the name of the dashboard tile in its aria-label value. Fixed An issue has been fixed where SDK API calls could return a 500 error if optional headers were not specified. The API calls now work as expected even if optional headers are not included. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the PDT Override Service Account field was not available for connections that use OAuth credentials. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the Manage Access dialog on a folder could load slowly if the Looker instance has a large number of groups. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where, previously, testing a new OAuth connection before saving would run connection tests on an empty connection. OAuth settings must now be saved before running connection tests. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed The OAuth Tenant ID field will no longer appear in connections for which it is not relevant. The only connection type that supports this field is Trino. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the API calls to run git connection tests would fail unless the user was in dev mode. These calls now work as expected whether the user is in production or development mode. Fixed An issue has been fixed where drill downs wouldn't be displayed for a field if the first field value had null values. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where assigning the user attribute looker_internal_email_domain_allowlist on the SAML config page would return a 500 error. This user attribute is not designed to be assigned at the user level, so the option to assign it has been removed from the SAML config page. Fixed An issue has been fixed where restarting the Looker instance during a folder sync could cause the instance to fail to start. Fixed An issue has been fixed where selecting fields from the Session view in the System Activity User Explore could cause fanout. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the count table calculation function could return incorrect values if its inputs included a list with null values. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the drill menu did not properly translate some entries when the locale was set to Swedish (sv_SE). This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where drilling on a query with subtotals could display incorrect values. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where filtering on a custom dimension that references a datetime type field could return the following error message: No matching signature . This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the LookML validator would return a 500 error if a LookML file contained a sum_distinct measure for a database that doesn't support sum_distinct measures. The LookML validator now returns a more descriptive error message. Fixed An issue has been fixed where entering the value 12:00 in the Time field of an alert schedule dialog would input 00:00 instead. Fixed An issue has been fixed where changes to PDT override settings would not be saved. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where PDTs could fail to rebuild with the following error message: undefined method trace_id_hex . This feature now performs as expected. Feature You can now embed Looker reports on Looker (original) instances when Looker reports and the Embed Looker reports Labs features are enabled for your instance. Looker reports are available in preview. Fixed An issue has been fixed where LDAP authentication could fail with the following error message: no implicit conversion of Hash into String . This feature now performs as expected. Feature The Code Interpreter in Conversational Analytics is now available in Preview . The Code Interpreter translates your natural language questions into Python code and executes that code to provide advanced analysis and visualizations. The Code Interpreter is disabled by default. Admins of Looker (Google Cloud core) instances can manage enablement for the Code Interpreter on the Gemini in Looker admin page . Note: This item was added on June 23, 2025. 2025-06-09 Announcement Gemini in Looker will be enabled by default for Looker (original) instances that meet at least one of the following criteria: The Automated Gemini in Looker enablement and user management setting on the Settings page in the Looker Admin panel was previously enabled. The instance is updated to Looker 25.6 or later after June 9, 2025. Instances that are hosted in the EMEA region and those that are enrolled in Looker's Extended Support Release (ESR) program are exempt from automatic enablement. Looker admins can still manage Gemini in Looker enablement manually on the Gemini in Looker page in the Admin panel.

While the 2.0.0 API is backwards-compatible with Embed SDK 1.8.x, the underlying implementation has changed for some functionality. SDK 1.8.x exported a number of classes. SDK 2.0.0 replaces these classes with interfaces that are marked as deprecated (alternative interfaces are identified). We recommend that applications use the interfaces that have an 'I' prefix (the interfaces that have prefixes are identical to the interfaces that don't have them). Applications that are upgraded to SDK 2.0.0 should continue to work and behave as they did previously. To take advantage of the API improvements, some refactoring will be required. The following major changes are included in Embed SDK 2.0.0: Navigating between dashboards, Explores, and Looks no longer requires that an iframe be recreated. Instead, the loadDashboard , loadLook , loadExplore , and loadUrl methods can be used to navigate within the Looker iframe. connect now returns a unified connection rather than a connection that is related only to a dashboard, a Look, or an Explore.

For more information, see Use custom organization policies . 2025-08-28 Fixed Certain Organization Policy managed constraints that were released on August 21, 2025 were not functioning as intended. The Organization Policy Service evaluated these constraints as if the effectiveInstanceMetadata field of the resources that they were enforced on was empty, causing them to always evaluate to either allow or deny access to the resource. The following managed constraints were evaluated to always allow creation of resources where they were enforced: constraints/compute.managed.disableGuestAttributesAccess constraints/compute.managed.disableSerialPortAccess constraints/compute.managed.disableSerialPortLogging The following managed constraints were evaluated to always block creation of resources where they were enforced: constraints/compute.managed.disallowGlobalDns constraints/compute.managed.requireOsConfig constraints/compute.managed.requireOsLogin This issue has been corrected, and these constraints now properly evaluate the effectiveInstanceMetadata field to determine whether resource creation should be allowed or blocked. 2025-08-18 Feature You can use custom constraints with Organization Policy to provide more granular control over specific fields for some Backup for GKE resources.

For more information, see Use custom organization policies . 2025-08-28 Fixed Certain Organization Policy managed constraints that were released on August 21, 2025 were not functioning as intended. The Organization Policy Service evaluated these constraints as if the effectiveInstanceMetadata field of the resources that they were enforced on was empty, causing them to always evaluate to either allow or deny access to the resource. The following managed constraints were evaluated to always allow creation of resources where they were enforced: constraints/compute.managed.disableGuestAttributesAccess constraints/compute.managed.disableSerialPortAccess constraints/compute.managed.disableSerialPortLogging The following managed constraints were evaluated to always block creation of resources where they were enforced: constraints/compute.managed.disallowGlobalDns constraints/compute.managed.requireOsConfig constraints/compute.managed.requireOsLogin This issue has been corrected, and these constraints now properly evaluate the effectiveInstanceMetadata field to determine whether resource creation should be allowed or blocked. 2025-08-18 Feature You can use custom constraints with Organization Policy to provide more granular control over specific fields for some Backup for GKE resources. For more information, see Manage Backup for GKE resources using custom constraints . This feature is generally available . Feature You can now use organization policy conditions to match a tag key.

Normally, an organization policy in dry-run mode that's inherited on a resource is overridden by the live organization policy set directly on that same resource. Not evaluating the live organization policy parameters in the inherited organization policy in dry-run mode led to inconsistent results.
