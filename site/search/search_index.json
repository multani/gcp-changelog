This new functionality shows details related to specific API addresses when viewing detected abuse in detected traffic. For usage information, see the Abuse Detection customer documentation for incident details. 2025-06-04 Announcement On June 4, 2025 we released an update to the Anomaly Detection model in Advanced API Security Abuse Detection. Note: Rollouts of this release to production instances will begin within two business days and may take four or more business days to complete across all Google Cloud zones. Your instances may not have the feature available until the rollout is complete. Feature New model for Abuse Detection's Advanced Anomaly Detection rule With this release, we introduced a new and improved machine learning model for anomaly detection in Advanced API Security. This new model includes the following improvements: Trained on customer-specific traffic patterns. The new model is trained exclusively on your organization's historical API traffic data. It continues to learn from your API traffic patterns over time to increase accuracy. Engineered by Google for anomaly detection. The new model is a custom Vertex AI-based machine learning model, engineered and also used internally by Google specifically to detect anomalies in traffic patterns. Usage requirements: In order to use this new model, you must explicitly opt in to allow the model to use your traffic and other data to train for anomaly detection. Note that your data is never shared with other customers for training purposes. The new model is not available for VPC-SC customers at this time. The new anomaly detection model replaces the old model, with no customer-facing changes to the API or UI. Upon opting in for model training, you can expect to start seeing detected anomalies within 6 hours. If you have already opted in to allow the older version of our anomaly detection model to use your traffic data for training, you will not need to opt in again.

API hub allows you to view, organize, and manage all of the APIs in your Apigee organization in one central location. To learn more, see What is Apigee API hub? No action on your part is required to provision API hub for your organization, with the following exceptions: If your Apigee organization has Data Residency or VPC Service Controls enabled, you must configure your API hub instance manually to support these services. See VPC Service Controls for API hub and API hub and data residency for more information. If your Apigee organization uses Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK), you must deprovision the Apigee API hub instance provided by default and recreate it to support CMEK. See Deprovision Apigee API hub and Provision API hub in the Cloud console for step-by-step instructions. Contact Google Cloud Support for questions or assistance.","title":"Feature"},{"location":"services/apigee-hybrid/","text":"Apigee hybrid 2025-06-04 Announcement hybrid v1.15.0 On June 4, 2025 we released an updated version of the Apigee hybrid software, 1.15.0.

Feature Apigee API hub is enabled for new Apigee organizations in supported regions. With this release, we are enabling Apigee API hub for new Apigee organizations in regions where API hub is supported . All new Apigee organizations, including hybrid organizations, that select an API hub-supported region for their Apigee Analytics region during provisioning will have access to API hub features at no additional cost. API hub allows you to view, organize, and manage all of the APIs in your Apigee organization in one central location. To learn more, see What is Apigee API hub? No action on your part is required to provision API hub for your organization, with the following exceptions: If your Apigee organization has Data Residency or VPC Service Controls enabled, you must configure your API hub instance manually to support these services. See VPC Service Controls for API hub and API hub and data residency for more information. If your Apigee organization uses Customer-Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK), you must deprovision the Apigee API hub instance provided by default and recreate it to support CMEK. See Deprovision Apigee API hub and Provision API hub in the Cloud console for step-by-step instructions.

Listed changes and features might not be available in some regions yet. Feature Improved the startup times of Airflow workers for environments that have a large number of custom PyPI packages installed. This feature was announced previously and is gradually rolling out over several releases. In this release, it's available in asia-east2, asia-northeast3, europe-central2, europe-west9, me-central1, me-west1, northamerica-northeast1, northamerica-northeast2, northamerica-south1, and us-west1 re Fixed (Available without upgrading) Fixed an issue where deleting a Cloud Composer 2 environment could fail when the environment's cluster was in the process of creating a node pool. Changed (Airflow 2.10.5) The apache-airflow-providers-cncf-kubernetes package was upgraded to version 10.5.0 from version 10.4.2. For changes in other packages, see the preinstalled packages changelog . Changed New Airflow builds are available in Cloud Composer 3: composer-3-airflow-2.10.5-build.7 (default) composer-3-airflow-2.9.3-build.27 Changed New images are available in Cloud Composer 2: composer-2.13.5-airflow-2.10.5 (default) composer-2.13.5-airflow-2.9.3 Deprecated Cloud Composer version 2.8.3 has reached its end of support period . 2025-06-16 Announcement We're planning to phase out the APIs that aren't required by Cloud Composer 3. Starting February 27, 2026 , the following APIs will become fully detachable . Deactivating these APIs won't cause the deactivation of the Cloud Composer API: artifactregistry.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com sqladmin.googleapis.com Starting May 27, 2026 , these APIs will no longer be enabled automatically when you enable the Cloud Composer API. To create Cloud Composer 2 environments in new projects, the group of detached APIs must be enabled manually. Existing Cloud Composer 3 and Cloud Composer 2 environments in projects where the Cloud Composer API is already enabled will not be impacted. You can do the following: After February 27, 2026 , if your project has only Cloud Composer 3 environments, then you can manually disable the detached APIs. After February 27, 2026 , if your project has Cloud Composer 2 environments, then we recommend keeping these APIs enabled because disabling them might lead to environment's malfunction. After May 27, 2026 , if you use automation scripts to provision Cloud Composer 2 environments, then make sure that the listed APIs are enabled in addition to the Cloud Composer API. 2025-06-13 Feature Cloud Composer pages in the Cloud Console now support the dark color theme. You can switch to the dark theme on the Appearance page in the Cloud Console. 2025-06-10 Announcement A new Cloud Composer release has started on June 10, 2025 .

This change rolls out gradually. In this release, it's available in asia-east1, asia-northeast2, asia-south1, europe-north1, europe-west3, us-east1, us-south1, and us-west2 regions. Changed (Cloud Composer 3) If a VPC network is attached to an environment, then all DNS addresses accessed by the Airflow components of the environment are resolved using the Cloud DNS configuration of the VPC network.

When we release version 3.36, we expect the new capabilities to be as shown here. Feature Configure storage of Screen Share recordings You can now configure how long to store Screen Share recordings in your external storage settings. You can also now store Screen Share recordings that originated from the Screen Share adapter. Administrators: The CRM Comments Creation Details pane at Settings > Operation Management has new Post Cobrowse recording link to CRM record settings. You need to contact Google support to enable Screen Share recordings. Feature Restrict auto-assignment for email queues You can now configure email queues so that incoming emails are auto-assigned only during queue operating hours or to agents who are signed in. Administrators: The Auto assignment dialog at Settings > Queue > Email Edit/View > [queue name] > Automatic assignment > Configure has two new checkboxes. Feature Salesforce: New closed record options for scheduled calls If you've integrated Google Cloud CCaaS with the Salesforce CRM, you can configure how your instance handles scheduled calls for closed records. Here are the configuration options that are available with Salesforce integrations: Don't look up record status . Your instance doesn't look up record status and makes the scheduled call regardless of whether the record is open or closed. Look up record status and reopen closed records . Your instance looks up record status before making a scheduled call and reopens records that are closed. Look up record status and cancel scheduled calls for closed records . Your instance looks up record status before making a scheduled call and cancels scheduled calls for records that are closed. Administrators: The CRM Record Creation Details pane at Settings > Operation Management has new settings at Closed record options when initiating an API-scheduled call . Fixed The following issues were addressed in this release: Fixed an issue where calls weren't being assigned to the correct agent in Google Cloud CCaaS reporting. Fixed an issue where calls weren't being assigned to the correct agent in the CRM. Fixed an issue where the communication between a virtual task assistant and an end-user was not included in the Agent Assist live transcript in the agent adapter. Fixed an issue where agent outbound calls generated incorrect URLs in reporting. URLs contained ticket instead of tickets . Fixed an issue where newly created global contact list destinations were not available in the Overcapacity Deflection settings for IVR queues. Fixed an issue where the on_email_thread_created event listener was mistakenly logging customer names and email addresses. Fixed an issue where uploading a new overcapacity deflection message didn't replace the existing message. Fixed an issue where agents were not being assigned chat sessions while routing was configured for deltacast. Fixed an issue where attachments were lost when: (1) A chat session was transfered to another agent, or (2) After a chat auto-dismissed, an end-user restarted the chat with the same agent in the same queue. Fixed an issue where chats didn't time out after being inactive for longer than the chat timeout setting for the queue. Fixed an issue where agents who were removed from a chat session using the Connected Chats page were not fully disconnected from the session. These agents remained in the conversation tile, couldn't remove themselves from the session, and couldn't receive new chats. Fixed an issue where chats initiated outside of working hours generated incorrect chat transcripts. Instead of indicating that the support center was closed, the transcipts indicated that customer support was experiencing high volume. Fixed an issue where an external agent and an end-user couldn't communicate after an internal agent did the following: (1) Answered the call, (2) Put the end-user on hold, (3) tranferred the call to a queue with auto redirect to an external number, and (4) failed to release the hold before leaving the call. Fixed an issue where end-users with a blocked phone number were able to contact support using chat. Fixed an issue where the global disposition list appeared in the chat adapter during wrap-up instead of the disposition list for the agent's queue. Fixed an issue where a barge-in event interrupted an agent's audio. Fixed an issue where call session recordings were either not being sent to external storage or they were sent in the wrong file format. Fixed an issue in advanced reporting dashboards where chats appeared in the chat waiting menu even after the chat sessions ended. Fixed an issue where the agent desktop translations in French (Canada) and Japanese were not complete. Fixed an issue where the system was generating duplicate After Call Work records for a single wrap-up. Fixed an issue where bulk upload containing new users assigned to teams failed. 2025-06-09 Announcement Salesforce ICU Update This is for Google Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) customers that use Salesforce integration with CCaaS. On June 15th, 2025 , Salesforce is rolling out an automatic upgrade to its International Components for Unicode (ICU) locale data. This affects how date, time, number, and currency formatting are handled across Apex, Visualforce, and Lightning components. This change affects Salesforce integrations that are using Apex API versions earlier than 45.0. These integrations use the legacy Java locale behavior, which could cause formatting discrepancies, incorrect parsing, or runtime errors. Solution Google has reviewed the CCaaS managed package and has updated the impacted classes to use safe, ICU-compatible parsing and formatting methods. This includes cleaning up legacy code that uses older API versions, which might affect this transition. The following table shows the affected classes: Affected classes Name API version UJETUtilsController 35.0 UJETUtilsControllerTests 35.0 UJETJWT 43.0 UJETJWTTests 43.0 UJETPageController 43.0 Required action To ensure compatibility with the Salesforce ICU update and prevent any operational impact, you must complete the following action before June 15th, 2025 : Install the v1.40 update . This installation updates the affected classes. No further action is required. What happens if you don't upgrade? If any part of your integration or Apex code uses versions earlier than 45.0 after June 15th, Salesforce will not apply the ICU formatting to those sections. This could potentially lead to issues, including the following: Incorrect date and time parsing Unexpected errors in workflows or automations Mismatch between Lightning and Classic behavior Breakage in integrations expecting consistent locale handling Google considers the affected classes in CC_AGENT_APP v1.38 to be safe. While some of the affected classes have legacy methods that are affected by this update, they are not being actively used and will be deprecated in version 1.40. Regardless, Google still recommends installing the v1.40 update. Not upgrading can potentially impact other solutions that are installed on the environment, as described in this communication. Defer the update As described in Enable the ICU Locale Formats , you can defer the automatic rollout of this update. To defer this update, follow these steps: From the Quick Find search box in Setup , enter User Interface . On the User Interface page, deselect the Enable ICU locale formats as part of the scheduled rollout checkbox. Important : This will only be effective if completed before June 15th 2025 . 2025-06-05 Announcement Patch 3.35.15 is released This patch does the following: Fixes an issue in agent desktop. When an agent had active chat sessions with two end-users simultaneously, the chat history was missing for one of the chats. ~~Fixes an issue where bulk user upload jobs on the Bulk User Management page got stuck and didn't complete.~~ Fixes an issue in agent desktop where the chat adapter was unavailable when a chat was received. 2025-05-28 Announcement Headless web SDK 3.6.5 is released This release does the following: Fixes an issue where duplicate messages from the virtual assistant appeared in the end-user's chat pane. Fixes an issue where end-users were able to reactivate inactive chats outside of operating hours. Fixes an issue with data collection forms, where the SDK timed out during the form server's first load attempt, causing a delay in the appearance of the form in the end-user's chat pane. 2025-05-27 Announcement Version 3.35 is released All release notes published on this date are part of version 3.35. The timing of the update to your instance depends on the deployment schedule that you have chosen. For more information, see Deployment schedules . Feature QM integration now includes chat session events You can now export chat session events to an external quality management (QM) system. After you configure the endpoint of your QM system in Google Cloud CCaaS, your chat session events can be streamed to the endpoint in real time. User experience change: The QM Integration dialog at Settings > Developer Settings > Session Data Export > QM Integration has a new QM Chat Events - send chat sessions events checkbox. For more information, see QM, SIPREC, and WFM integration . Feature Remove email subject lines from interaction data We now support removing email subject lines when you delete interaction data from your instance for specified end-users. The email subjects are removed when you delete data for an end-user in the Consumer Privacy dialog at Settings > Consumer Management > Consumer Privacy . To completely remove an end-user's data, you must also delete their emails from your mail server. You must also delete chat transcripts, call recordings, and other session-related files from your CRM or external storage, depending on your configuration. For more information, see Remove subject lines from end-user email interactions . Feature New sender email with auto-response emails You can now configure an outbound-only email address and use it as the sender address for auto-response emails. The outbound-only address is a \"no-reply\" email address that prevents the receiver from responding. User experience changes: The Auto-response dialog at Settings > Queue > Email > [your-email-queue] > Auto-response has a new Sender email field. The Add an email dialog at Settings > Developer Settings > Email Account Management > Email account list > Add email account has a new This is an outbound only email account checkbox.

On June 15th, 2025 , Salesforce is rolling out an automatic upgrade to its International Components for Unicode (ICU) locale data. This affects how date, time, number, and currency formatting are handled across Apex, Visualforce, and Lightning components. This change affects Salesforce integrations that are using Apex API versions earlier than 45.0. These integrations use the legacy Java locale behavior, which could cause formatting discrepancies, incorrect parsing, or runtime errors. Solution Google has reviewed the CCaaS managed package and has updated the impacted classes to use safe, ICU-compatible parsing and formatting methods. This includes cleaning up legacy code that uses older API versions, which might affect this transition. The following table shows the affected classes: Affected classes Name API version UJETUtilsController 35.0 UJETUtilsControllerTests 35.0 UJETJWT 43.0 UJETJWTTests 43.0 UJETPageController 43.0 Required action To ensure compatibility with the Salesforce ICU update and prevent any operational impact, you must complete the following action before June 15th, 2025 : Install the v1.40 update . This installation updates the affected classes. No further action is required. What happens if you don't upgrade? If any part of your integration or Apex code uses versions earlier than 45.0 after June 15th, Salesforce will not apply the ICU formatting to those sections. This could potentially lead to issues, including the following: Incorrect date and time parsing Unexpected errors in workflows or automations Mismatch between Lightning and Classic behavior Breakage in integrations expecting consistent locale handling Google considers the affected classes in CC_AGENT_APP v1.38 to be safe. While some of the affected classes have legacy methods that are affected by this update, they are not being actively used and will be deprecated in version 1.40. Regardless, Google still recommends installing the v1.40 update. Not upgrading can potentially impact other solutions that are installed on the environment, as described in this communication. Defer the update As described in Enable the ICU Locale Formats , you can defer the automatic rollout of this update. To defer this update, follow these steps: From the Quick Find search box in Setup , enter User Interface . On the User Interface page, deselect the Enable ICU locale formats as part of the scheduled rollout checkbox.

While the 2.0.0 API is backwards-compatible with Embed SDK 1.8.x, the underlying implementation has changed for some functionality. SDK 1.8.x exported a number of classes. SDK 2.0.0 replaces these classes with interfaces that are marked as deprecated (alternative interfaces are identified). We recommend that applications use the interfaces that have an 'I' prefix (the interfaces that have prefixes are identical to the interfaces that don't have them). Applications that are upgraded to SDK 2.0.0 should continue to work and behave as they did previously. To take advantage of the API improvements, some refactoring will be required. The following major changes are included in Embed SDK 2.0.0: Navigating between dashboards, Explores, and Looks no longer requires that an iframe be recreated. Instead, the loadDashboard , loadLook , loadExplore , and loadUrl methods can be used to navigate within the Looker iframe. connect now returns a unified connection rather than a connection that is related only to a dashboard, a Look, or an Explore. The unified connection allows embedding applications to detect a user navigating inside the iframe. Support for additional Looker embedded content has been added for Looker reports and query visualizations. Note: This item was added on June 13, 2025. Feature For period-over-period (PoP) measures, a new subparameter, value_to_date , is available. When a PoP measure is defined with value_to_date:yes , Looker will calculate the amount of time in the current timeframe at the time that the query is run and apply that amount of time when it calculates the values for previous periods. Feature The Firebolt JDBC driver has been updated to version 3.5.0. Feature The Hive JDBC driver has been updated to version 4.0.1. Feature The MS SQL JDBC driver has been updated to version 12.10.0. Feature The Teradata JDBC driver has been updated to version 20.00.00.45. Feature The Vertica JDBC driver has been updated to version 24.2.0-1. Feature The new Content Guardrails admin panel lets Looker admins limit both the ability for users to add or execute merged results queries on dashboards and the use of the dashboard auto-refresh option. Limiting merged results queries and dashboard auto-refreshes can reduce the number of queries that are sent to the database and improve dashboard performance. Note: This item was added on June 12, 2025. Feature The Looker Continuous Integration (CI) features let you run tests on your LookML project to deliver more reliable, efficient, and user-friendly data experiences. You can use the CI validators to catch issues with SQL, data test, content, and LookML before they hit production to verify your LookML and prevent query errors for your users. You can also configure the CI validators to run automatically when a pull request is submitted to your LookML repository. Note: This item was added on June 23, 2025. Fixed This release contains the following accessibility improvements: Increased contrast ratio for graphic elements, including icon bullets Improved contrast for download links and unemphasized text to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Level AA Fixed The Tile Actions kebab menu now includes the name of the dashboard tile in its aria-label value. Fixed An issue has been fixed where SDK API calls could return a 500 error if optional headers were not specified. The API calls now work as expected even if optional headers are not included. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the PDT Override Service Account field was not available for connections that use OAuth credentials. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the Manage Access dialog on a folder could load slowly if the Looker instance has a large number of groups. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where, previously, testing a new OAuth connection before saving would run connection tests on an empty connection. OAuth settings must now be saved before running connection tests. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed The OAuth Tenant ID field will no longer appear in connections for which it is not relevant. The only connection type that supports this field is Trino. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the API calls to run git connection tests would fail unless the user was in dev mode. These calls now work as expected whether the user is in production or development mode. Fixed An issue has been fixed where drill downs wouldn't be displayed for a field if the first field value had null values. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where assigning the user attribute looker_internal_email_domain_allowlist on the SAML config page would return a 500 error. This user attribute is not designed to be assigned at the user level, so the option to assign it has been removed from the SAML config page. Fixed An issue has been fixed where restarting the Looker instance during a folder sync could cause the instance to fail to start. Fixed An issue has been fixed where selecting fields from the Session view in the System Activity User Explore could cause fanout. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the count table calculation function could return incorrect values if its inputs included a list with null values. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the drill menu did not properly translate some entries when the locale was set to Swedish (sv_SE). This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where drilling on a query with subtotals could display incorrect values. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where filtering on a custom dimension that references a datetime type field could return the following error message: No matching signature . This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where the LookML validator would return a 500 error if a LookML file contained a sum_distinct measure for a database that doesn't support sum_distinct measures. The LookML validator now returns a more descriptive error message. Fixed An issue has been fixed where entering the value 12:00 in the Time field of an alert schedule dialog would input 00:00 instead. Fixed An issue has been fixed where changes to PDT override settings would not be saved. This feature now performs as expected. Fixed An issue has been fixed where PDTs could fail to rebuild with the following error message: undefined method trace_id_hex . This feature now performs as expected. Feature You can now embed Looker reports on Looker (original) instances when Looker reports and the Embed Looker reports Labs features are enabled for your instance. Looker reports are available in preview. Fixed An issue has been fixed where LDAP authentication could fail with the following error message: no implicit conversion of Hash into String . This feature now performs as expected. Feature The Code Interpreter in Conversational Analytics is now available in Preview . The Code Interpreter translates your natural language questions into Python code and executes that code to provide advanced analysis and visualizations. The Code Interpreter is disabled by default. Admins of Looker (Google Cloud core) instances can manage enablement for the Code Interpreter on the Gemini in Looker admin page . Note: This item was added on June 23, 2025. 2025-06-09 Announcement Gemini in Looker will be enabled by default for Looker (original) instances that meet at least one of the following criteria: The Automated Gemini in Looker enablement and user management setting on the Settings page in the Looker Admin panel was previously enabled. The instance is updated to Looker 25.6 or later after June 9, 2025. Instances that are hosted in the EMEA region and those that are enrolled in Looker's Extended Support Release (ESR) program are exempt from automatic enablement. Looker admins can still manage Gemini in Looker enablement manually on the Gemini in Looker page in the Admin panel. Feature When the Automated Gemini in Looker enablement and user management setting is enabled, the Gemini Default Users group is created automatically for instances that use an open system configuration . The Gemini Default Users group is populated automatically with all existing users and any new users who are added to the instance.","title":"Looker"},{"location":"services/looker/#looker","text":"","title":"Looker"},{"location":"services/looker/#2025-06-24","text":"","title":"2025-06-24"},{"location":"services/looker/#feature","text":"The following feature is generally available for Looker reports: The Looker connector can now connect to a private IP (private services access) only Looker (Google Cloud core) instance or to a private IP (Private Service Connect) Looker (Google Cloud core) instance using the Looker instance ID .","title":"Feature"},{"location":"services/looker/#2025-06-11","text":"","title":"2025-06-11"},{"location":"services/looker/#announcement","text":"Looker 25.10 is expected to include the following changes, features, and fixes: Expected Looker (original) deployment start: Tuesday, June 17, 2025 Expected Looker (original) final deployment and download available: Thursday, June 26, 2025 Expected Looker (Google Cloud core) deployment start: Monday, June 16, 2025 Expected Looker (Google Cloud core) final deployment: Monday, June 30, 2025","title":"Announcement"},{"location":"services/looker/#breaking","text":"The Embed SDK has been upgraded to release 2.0.0.
