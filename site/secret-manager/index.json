This process allows applications to access secrets from Secret Manager using standard Kubernetes methods, such as environment variables or volume mounts. Applications that are already configured to read secrets from Kubernetes Secret object can now seamlessly read secrets in Secret Manager.\n\nFor more information, see [Synchronize secrets to Kubernetes Secrets](https://cloud.google.com/secret-manager/docs/sync-k8-secrets).",
