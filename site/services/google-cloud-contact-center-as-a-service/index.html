<h3 id="announcement_3">Announcement</h3>
<p><strong>Salesforce ICU Update</strong></p>
<p>This is for Google Contact Center as a Service (CCaaS) customers that use Salesforce integration with CCaaS.</p>
<p>On <strong>June 15th, 2025</strong>, Salesforce is rolling out an automatic upgrade to its International Components for Unicode (ICU) locale data. This affects how date, time, number, and currency formatting are handled across Apex, Visualforce, and Lightning components.</p>
<p>This change affects Salesforce integrations that are using Apex API versions earlier than 45.0. These integrations use the legacy Java locale behavior, which could cause formatting discrepancies, incorrect parsing, or runtime errors.</p>
<p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
<p>Google has reviewed the CCaaS managed package and has updated the impacted classes to use safe, ICU-compatible parsing and formatting methods. This includes cleaning up legacy code that uses older API versions, which might affect this transition.</p>
<p>The following table shows the affected classes:</p>
<p><strong>Affected classes</strong></p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>API version</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><code>UJETUtilsController</code></td>
<td>35.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>UJETUtilsControllerTests</code></td>
<td>35.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>UJETJWT</code></td>
<td>43.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>UJETJWTTests</code></td>
<td>43.0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>UJETPageController</code></td>
<td>43.0</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Required action</strong></p>
<p>To ensure compatibility with the Salesforce ICU update and prevent any operational impact, you must complete the following action before <strong>June 15th, 2025</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the <a href="https://login.salesforce.com/?ec=302&amp;startURL=%2Fpackaging%2FinstallPackage.apexp%3Fp0%3D04tKk0000011MNw%26InstHostname%3Dlogin.salesforce.com">v1.40 update</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This installation updates the affected classes. No further action is required.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if you don't upgrade?</strong></p>
<p>If any part of your integration or Apex code uses versions earlier than 45.0 after June 15th, Salesforce will not apply the ICU formatting to those sections. This could potentially lead to issues, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorrect date and time parsing</li>
<li>Unexpected errors in workflows or automations</li>
<li>Mismatch between Lightning and Classic behavior</li>
<li>Breakage in integrations expecting consistent locale handling</li>
</ul>
<p>Google considers the affected classes in CC_AGENT_APP v1.38 to be safe. While some of the affected classes have legacy methods that are affected by this update, they are not being actively used and will be deprecated in version 1.40. Regardless, Google still recommends installing the v1.40 update. Not upgrading can potentially impact other solutions that are installed on the environment, as described in this communication.</p>
<p><strong>Defer the update</strong></p>
<p>As described in <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=xcloud.icu_migration_enable.htm&amp;type=5">Enable the ICU Locale Formats</a>, you can defer the automatic rollout of this update.</p>
<p>To defer this update, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>From the Quick Find search box in <strong>Setup</strong>, enter <strong>User Interface</strong>.</li>
<li>On the User Interface page, deselect the <strong>Enable ICU locale formats as part of the scheduled rollout</strong> checkbox.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Important</strong>: This will only be effective if completed before <strong>June 15th 2025</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Remove email subject lines from interaction data</strong></p>
<p>We now support removing email subject lines when you delete interaction data from your instance for specified end-users. The email subjects are removed when you delete data for an end-user in the <strong>Consumer Privacy</strong> dialog at <strong>Settings &gt; Consumer Management &gt; Consumer Privacy</strong>. To completely remove an end-user's data, you must also delete their emails from your mail server. You must also delete chat transcripts, call recordings, and other session-related files from your CRM or external storage, depending on your configuration.</p>

<p><strong>New sender email with auto-response emails</strong></p>
