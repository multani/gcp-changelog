    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Vertex AI Search: Natural language query filters (GA)</strong></p>
<p>For queries on structured data stores, the natural language queries can be
reformulated as filters and a residual query. For example, "Find a coffee shop
serving banana bread" becomes <code>"query": "banana bread", "filter": "type":
ANY("cafe")</code>.</p>
<p>The natural-language query understanding feature only applies to custom search
apps attached to a single, structured, data store.</p>
<p>By default, a hard restriction filter is applied, but a softer, boost-like
filter can be used instead.</p>
<p>This feature is generally available (GA). For more information, see <a href="https://docs.cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/natural-language-queries">Filter with
natural language
understanding</a>.</p>]]></content>
    <summary>Vertex AI Search now supports natural language query filters for structured data stores. This feature allows users to search using conversational language, which is then translated into precise filters and queries. For example, "Find a coffee shop serving banana bread" can become a query with a filter for "cafe" type and a search for "banana bread". This enhances the usability of custom search applications built on single, structured data stores. The feature is now generally available.</summary>

<p>You can specify an allowlist of fields to be used for filter extraction. If you
have some fields, perhaps for internal use, that you don't want to be used in
filters, then specify an allowlist to restrict the fields that can be used.</p>
