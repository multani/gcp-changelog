There are two subscriptions, one for storage and one for search queries,\nplus add-ons that let you add more features according to your needs.\n\nFor storage, the minimum subscription is 50 GiB/month and the available\nadd-on is semantic embedding. For search queries, the minimum subscription is\n1000 queries per minute per project, and the available add-ons are semantic\nquery, KPI & personalization, and AI overview.\n\nAfter you set up configurable pricing for a project, apply configurable pricing\nto apps and data stores as needed. In a project, you can have some apps and\ndata store using the general pricing and others using configurable pricing.\n\nConfigurable pricing is generally available (GA).
